## Introduction and Context

### Episode Background

Sarah Adams returns as the most requested repeat guest in Shawn Ryan Show history. Her first appearance discussing Benghazi received significant viewership but was subsequently censored on YouTube, making it difficult to find by searching her name directly. The episode can only be found by navigating directly to the channel or searching for her CIA call sign "Super Bad."

### Sarah Adams Background

- **Former Position:** CIA counterterrorism analyst and targeter
- **Specialization:** Libya desk officer during Benghazi crisis (before, during, and after 9/11/2012 attacks)
- **Current Work:** Co-author of "Benghazi: Know Thy Enemy - A Cold Case Investigation"
- **Additional Role:** Senior advisor on the Select Committee on Benghazi
- **Current Focus:** Tracking terrorist organizations and their movements globally

### Statement on Personal Life

Adams addressed numerous marriage proposals in YouTube comments from first appearance, stating she is "married to her terrorists" - meaning her work tracking terrorist organizations is her primary focus and she does not have time for dating.

## Current Terrorist Threats and Attack Vectors

### Types of Attacks Planned

**Question from Patreon supporter Leo:** What type of attacks and locations do terrorists foresee targeting?

**Adams' Response:**
- Terrorist attack preferences remain consistent: soft targets that embarrass governments
- Recent "Lone Wolf" propaganda videos from Al-Qaeda (specifically Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and ISIS encouraging inspired attacks
- Focus on crowds and public gatherings

### Specific Embassy Threats

Adams identifies two U.S. embassies under active threat:
1. **U.S. Embassy in Bamako, Mali**
2. **U.S. Embassy on Saudi Peninsula**

**Reasoning:** Terrorists are actively working on attacks at these locations. Historical pattern shows embassy attacks as effective means to push U.S. government out of regions (referencing 1990s embassy bombings).

### Paris Olympics Threat

ISIS released propaganda specifically targeting Paris Olympics:
- Encouraged attacks on crowds surrounding Olympic events
- Suggested using any available weapons (knives, vehicles)
- Primary distribution platform: Telegram

### Infrastructure vs. Soft Target Threats

**Question from Patreon supporter Brody:** Are attacks on infrastructure (power grid, water supply) or soft targets more likely?

**Adams' Analysis:**
- **Two distinct threat categories:**
  - **Terrorist groups:** Focus on soft targets and human casualties
  - **Nation-states (China, near-peer adversaries):** Focus on infrastructure and power grid
- China has already gained control of portions of U.S. electric grid and ports
- This positioning would allow disruption of U.S. response capability in conflict scenario

## Southern Border and Immigration Issues

### Routes and Methods

**Primary exit points for terrorists traveling to U.S.:**
1. **India**
2. **Turkey**
3. **Iran**

### TikTok as Smuggling Tool

**Revolutionary Discovery:** Chinese and African migrants using TikTok as human trafficking/smuggling application

**TikTok provides:**
- Route planning through multiple countries
- Border crossing instructions
- Visa acquisition guidance
- Flight information to South America
- Location of aid stations and medical facilities
- Identification of friendly NGOs along route
- Complete routing from origin to U.S. southern border

Adams compares this to how U.S. military would use AAC (automated air coordination) for movement planning.

### South American Visa Issues

**Countries facilitating travel:**
- **Brazil**
- **Colombia**
- **Ecuador**
- **Panama**

**Critical Policy:** Ecuador allows Chinese citizens to enter without a visa, contributing to 6,000% increase in Chinese nationals at U.S. border.

**Adams' Recommendation:** U.S. should:
1. Pressure South American countries to require visas for Chinese nationals
2. Leverage U.S. aid as diplomatic tool
3. Address pipeline further south rather than only at border

### Darien Gap and NGO Involvement

**NGO Role:**
- Non-governmental organizations provide humanitarian assistance along migration routes
- Unintentionally assist illegal migrants and potential threats
- Create "security blankets" that make journey easier
- Provide cover and association that changes security situation
- Increase migration volume by improving route safety

**Adams' Assessment:** Mix of incompetence and misguided "white savior complex"

**Example Cited:** Kabul evacuation where 120,000 people evacuated, approximately 70,000 with unknown identities due to NGO pressure to accept people without proper identification.

### Chinese vs. Terrorist Threats

**Both considered equal but different threats:**

**Chinese Threat:**
- Chinese nationals loyal to Chinese government, not U.S.
- Cultural difference: Chinese citizens don't criticize government like Americans do
- In conflict scenario, would choose Chinese government over U.S.
- Represent insider threat and potential fifth column

**Terrorist Threat:**
- Take direction from terrorist organizations
- Involved in multiple criminal enterprises: money laundering, drug trafficking, child exploitation
- Anyone willing to commit crime of illegal entry is involved in other crimes

**Example:** Benghazi attacker captured in October for raping a child - demonstrates terrorists' involvement in broad criminal activity.

### Border Statistics Issues

**Problems with Current Data:**
- U.S. government "skewing numbers"
- Categories like "Latin American" and "Other" prevent country-by-country analysis
- Cannot determine specific numbers of Egyptians, Syrians, Afghans, etc. crossing border
- Lack of transparency prevents accurate threat assessment

### Afghan Passports and Terrorist Travel

**Taliban-Issued Passports Strategy:**

**Two-tier deployment system:**
1. **Trained fighters:** New recruits trained at Al-Qaeda camps, given Afghan passports, forward-deployed without specific cell structure (different from historical model where entire cells deployed together)

2. **Senior leaders:** Al-Qaeda veterans (20+ years experience) given Afghan passports with false identities
   - **Example:** Egyptian Al-Qaeda member now carries Afghan passport
   - Deployed to U.S., Middle East, and Europe
   - Serve as "command central" for deployed fighters
   - Will direct operations when fighters are ready

**Vetting Impossibility:**
- Most terrorists dropping IDs at border
- No way to verify true nationality
- New recruits with no prior terrorist record: no fingerprints in system, no photos on file, not on watchlists

**Case Study - Mullah Baradar:**
- Lived in Pakistan with Pakistani identity (Muhammad Arif)
- Pakistani passport showed different name, father's name, nationality
- U.S. watchlist had only estimated date of birth (not specific)
- Pakistani passport showed only year of birth (1963)
- "One of top 21 terrorists in world at the time would have come in just fine" if he approached southern border

### Sleeper Cells in U.S.

**Adams' Assessment:**
- Not aware of training camps within U.S.
- Pre-training occurs in Afghanistan (30 camps)
- Thousands likely already present in U.S.
- No accurate estimation method available

**Why No Attacks Yet:**
- Lone wolves can act independently, but organized attacks require guidance and coordination
- Al-Qaeda has new command structure requiring senior commanders to be positioned first
- Commanders must be in place before activating deployed fighters
- Al-Qaeda has other priorities consuming bandwidth:
  1. Deploying trainees to Iraq/Syria to attack U.S. and Israeli forces
  2. Fat War plan (taking territory in Pakistan/Afghanistan border region)

---

## Terrorist Organization Convergence

### Breaking Down Traditional Intelligence Silos

**Historical U.S. Government Approach:**
- Different terrorist groups handled in separate "buckets"
- ISIS analysts work ISIS
- Al-Qaeda analysts work Al-Qaeda
- Hamas virtually unstudied
- No cross-functional analysis of how groups share resources, conduct joint training, coordinate operations

### Hamas-Al-Qaeda-Afghanistan Connection

**October 2023 Hamas Attacks:**
- Large number of Hamas attackers trained in southern Afghanistan prior to attacks
- Training locations: Uruzgan and Kandahar provinces
- Trained at Al-Qaeda camps
- If U.S. had been collecting on "Why are Palestinian terrorists training in Afghanistan?" attack might have been prevented
- Ignored because conventional wisdom said "Hamas doesn't align with Al-Qaeda" and "they're Shia/Iran-backed"

**Reality:** Al-Qaeda and Iran have been "super close" - Iran (along with Pakistan) provided safe haven for Al-Qaeda senior leaders during entire 20-year war when U.S. was "trying to hunt them unsuccessfully inside Afghanistan"

### Libya: Al-Qaeda and ISIS Convergence

**Mutual Enemy Brings Cooperation:**
- Al-Qaeda and ISIS came together in Libya against common enemy: Libyan National Army
- Traditional narrative of these groups as enemies doesn't match reality

**Case Study - Hashim Abu Cidra:**
- Captured in Libya several months before interview (didn't make U.S. press)
- **Dual role:** Head of ISIS in Libya AND head of operational side of Al-Qaeda in Libya
- "Against narratives - operational head of two groups you're told don't work together"
- Detention briefings focused only on ISIS activities, not Al-Qaeda role
- This is a **Benghazi attacker**
- Led major AQIM (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb) battalion during Benghazi attacks
- Demonstrates Al-Qaeda being downplayed even in foreign country interrogations

**Adams' Source:** Nine years of work in Libya, extensive relationship network, only organization working Benghazi investigation, people proactively reach out with information

### Government Compartmentalization Continues

**Has U.S. government fixed the problem of segregating terrorist groups?**

**Adams: "Of course not."**

Compartmentalization remains 100% in place.

## Benghazi Investigation Updates

### The Mortar Team Discovery

**Significance:** Mortar attack at CIA Annex killed Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty (the "SEAL team calls him Rone") - September 11-12, 2012

**Investigation Challenge - 4,000 Days:**

**Initial Wrong Assumption:**
- Assumed mortar team worked under Wasam Bin Hamid (deceased), who planned the mortar attack
- Spent extensive time investigating Libya Shield militia (Bin Hamid's group)
- Wrong approach: Bin Hamid called "best mortar team in town" that night, not his own group

**Actual Mortar Team Identity:**

**The Hassan Al-Jabber Cell:**
- Named after Al Jazeera journalist killed in ambush
- Journalist was en route to interview General Abdul Fatah Younis (one of two General Haftars)
- Terrorists ambushed journalist's team (video available on YouTube)
- One security detail member survived, known to Adams

**Connected Ambush Context:**
- Target was actually General Younis, not journalist
- Terrorists involved in Younis killing: Aman Abu Khattala (whom U.S. framed as Benghazi "mastermind"), Muhammad Bin Hamid (Wasam's brother)
- Likely Adams' terrorists who killed both General and journalist

**Organizational Structure:**
- Hassan Al-Jabber Cell operated within **Rafallah al-Sehati Brigades**
- Rafallah al-Sehati Brigades was cell within **17th February Martyrs Brigade**

**17th February Martyrs Brigade:**
- Libyan government-provided security outside U.S. consulate
- **Blue Mountain Group:** Private security company for local guards inside compound (State Department contract)

**Blue Mountain Group Terrorist Connection:**
- Terrorist captured months before interview for child rape was Blue Mountain Group member
- U.S. government consistently denied Blue Mountain Group had any terrorists
- Can't get story into U.S. press because "State Department paid for that attacker"

**Rafallah al-Sehati Involvement:**
- Provided mortar team
- Also had attackers at consulate
- Involved in both attack locations

### Muhammad al-Gharabi - Al-Qaeda Commander

**Position:** Al-Qaeda Commander for Benghazi at time of attacks

**Background:**
- Fought with Al-Qaeda in Mujahedin Afghanistan
- Led Rafallah al-Sehati group
- **Top 10 in Adams' investigation**
- Travels between Libya and Turkey

**U.S. Intelligence Failure:**
- U.S. did not know his Al-Qaeda command position
- Only knew him as "commander of Rafallah al-Sehati"
- Thought of as "Islamist militia" not Al-Qaeda

**Adams' Assessment:** "If you actually learn who these people are and what their roles are, it's just all Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda asks Al-Qaeda guys to do everything."

### FBI Response to Mortar Team Identification

**Timeline:** Information shared first week of November (2023) with:
- FBI
- State Department's Rewards for Justice program

**FBI Response:** No response received

**Meanwhile:** Department of Justice planning to **retry** Ahmed Abu Khattala (the "fake mastermind") summer 2024

**First Trial Results:**
- 22 years sentence for someone who "wasn't the mastermind, showed up late, hung out outside until Al-Qaeda left, went in and grabbed useless items" (nothing classified at consulate)

**Retry Plans:**
- DOJ contacted CIA Annex personnel to testify against Khattala again
- Focus remains on "fake mastermind" while ignoring actual mortar team
- Team "pretty frankly pissed off" about situation

### FBI Witness Revelation

**Five members of 10-person mortar team were family members of FBI's key witness** in Khattala trial

**FBI Witness Details:**
- Libyan paid millions of dollars
- Moved to United States
- Testified Khattala was "mastermind" (investigation proved he wasn't - real mastermind is "Maz Maz," famous AQIM commander)
- Covered up family members' involvement in attacks
- **Lives in Virginia**

**Additional Crimes:**
- **2011:** Kidnapped, tortured, and killed Libyan intelligence officer Nasser al-Sani
- Wanted for war crime in Benghazi
- Libyan trials ongoing for this murder
- U.S. harboring this witness prevents justice for al-Sani family

**Ahmed Abu Khattala Protection:**
- Also killed a general, has potential death penalty in Benghazi
- FBI framing him as fake mastermind "kept him alive"
- Should already be on death row in Libya for that crime
- "We're actually protecting terrorists as part of this Benghazi cover-up"

### CIA Annex Team Letter

**Authors:**
- Sarah Adams (targeter)
- Case officer
- Comm officer
- Entire GRS (Global Response Staff) team

**Message to FBI witness:** "The entire CIA Annex team knows where you live, we know what you drive, stay the hell away from us"

**Adams on speaking out:** "FBI did a failed investigation, they brought a terrorist to America. Someone has to say what they did wrong because he's a threat. He needs to be deported immediately and face trial for the murder in Libya."

### Captured Benghazi Attackers

**Since last interview, two captured:**

1. **Hashim Abu Cidra** (mentioned earlier)
   - Head of ISIS in Libya
   - Head of Al-Qaeda operations in Libya
   - Top 10 terrorist globally
   - Runs entire Sahel (everything through that portion of Africa)
   - Controls weapons, drugs, human trafficking across region
   - Operates Al-Qaeda and ISIS as "billion-dollar organizations" in Libya, run "more as businesses than terrorist groups"

2. **Faraj Shaku**
   - Thought to be dead (reportedly killed in U.S. drone strike)
   - Battle damage assessment by U.S. military "horrible in Libya"
   - Captured October for raping a child

**U.S. Response:** Has not asked for access or deportation of either

### The Mastermind Question

**Real Benghazi Attack Masterminds:**

**Consulate Attack:** Taken out by French forces (on Adams' birthday - "Thank you, France")

**CIA Annex Attack:** Wasam Bin Hamid - taken out by Libyan National Army and Emirati Air Force

**Other Top Two AQIM Leaders:** Taken out by French forces

**Adams' Lesson:** "U.S. is not the only one who's going to go after these guys. We need to move beyond that fact."

## Al-Qaeda Training and Operations

### Current Training Camp Network

**Total Camps:** 30 Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan

**Breakdown:**
- **7 camps:** Suicide bomber training exclusively
- **23 camps:** General training

### Training Curriculum

**Standard Training:**
- Weapons training
- Driving training
- Physical endurance
- Urban warfare (specific threat identified)

**Not Included:**
- No new training innovations
- No IED construction programs (notably absent)

**Urban Warfare Camp:** Adams believes this is for "specific threat" - later proved correct regarding embassy attacks

### Scale of Recruitment

**Numbers:**
- **By end of 2024:** 100,000 newly trained Al-Qaeda recruits expected
- **Taliban military (last 2 years):** Recruited 170,000 new members
- **ISIS (all locations combined):** Approximately 20,000 members total
  - Iraq and Syria: 5,000 fighters
  - Beluchistan: Moved leadership
  - Training camps in Pakistan

**Comparison:** Al-Qaeda now five times larger than ISIS and growing

### New Operational Model

**Departure from Historical Model:**
- Old system: Train cell together, deploy cell together, cell conducts attack
- New system: Train individuals, forward-deploy separately, senior leader coordinates later

**Two-Tier System:**
1. Trained fighters deployed individually or in small groups
2. Senior Al-Qaeda members (20+ years experience) with false Afghan passports positioned as coordinators

**Implications:**
- Cells won't operate as previously observed
- May appear as "lone wolf" attacks but actually coordinated
- Command structure separated from fighters until activation

### Vetting Impossibility

**The "Mohammad" Problem:**
- New recruits with no terrorist history
- Fingerprints not in any system
- Photos not available
- Not on U.S. watchlists
- Not marked as terrorists anywhere

**Even Known Terrorists Pass Through:**
- Watchlisted terrorists can still enter
- Different names on various passports
- Estimated dates of birth don't match passport data
- False nationalities

## Afghanistan: Taliban, ISIS-K, and Al-Qaeda

### Abdul Azim Ali Musa Ben Ali - The Document Forger

**Identity:**
- Full name: Abdul Azim Ali Musa Ben Ali
- Libyan family name: al-Darsi (not always used)
- Investigation calls him "Musa"
- **NUMBER ONE TARGET of Benghazi investigation** for preventing future attacks

**Historical Role:**
- Fought with Al-Qaeda in Mujahedin era
- Became "Clandestine Officer" in Al-Qaeda
- Adams' team investigated him like "undercover CIA guy in Al-Qaeda"
- Never publicly revealed they were following him until this interview

**Career - Document Forgery:**
- **One job forever:** Make fake travel documents for Al-Qaeda external operatives
- Started in Afghanistan
- Made documents for Benghazi attackers (prepared in advance so terrorists could flee via airport when they thought U.S. military would respond)

**Example of Passport Use:**
- Al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist captured in Turkey with fake passport
- U.S. didn't ask for extradition
- Sent to Tunisia, released
- U.S. claimed "we're following him" - they weren't
- Killed political leaders in Tunisia
- Went to Syria
- Eventually killed with brother in Syria strikes

### Khorasan Group Connection

**Formation:** Around time of Benghazi attacks, Al-Qaeda created specialized external operations group

**Purpose:** Focus all external operations (Europe and U.S. attacks) into one unit

**Leadership:** Muhsin Fadhil (leader)

**U.S. Response:** Became top priority, struck repeatedly, "basically wiped out the Khorasan Group"

**Musa's Role:**
- Khorasan Group's sole travel facilitator
- Specialized in Turkey operations
- Focused on Turkish documents (easy to obtain through fraud, grants Europe access)

### Al-Badri Brigade Documents

**Al-Badri Brigade:** Libyan terrorists who joined ISIS in Syria (not Al-Nusra Front)

**Attacks Conducted:**
- Ariana Grande concert (Manchester bombing)
- Multiple attacks in France
- Bataclan theater attack

**Context:** Libyans have pattern of forming own groups. Those steering toward ISIS (vs. Al-Nusra) called themselves Al-Badri Brigade.

**Musa provided travel documents for this group**

### Musa's Disappearance and Rediscovery

**Lost in Investigation:**
- Last known: Libya, Syria, Turkey
- Spent time in France (around time of French attacks, notably Nice)
- Assumed living under assumed identity in Turkey or Syria (since he can make any identity)

**Found:** While following Hamza al-Darsi in Afghanistan

**Discovery:** Musa had been hiding and protected by Iranian government in Iran

**Current Position (as of interview):**
- Works for **Sirajuddin Haqqani** in Taliban's Ministry of Interior
- Sole job: Makes all fake travel documents for Al-Qaeda external operatives leaving Afghanistan

**Significance:**
- Involved in Benghazi
- Ignored since Benghazi
- **Now: One man who knows every terrorist Al-Qaeda is deploying from Afghanistan**
- U.S. has "no interest in him - none"

**His Boss:** Sirajuddin Haqqani - whom U.S. gives money to weekly

### Abbey Gate Attack - Masterminds

**Context:** August 26, 2021 suicide bombing at Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members, approximately 170 Afghans

**Suicide Bomber:** Released from Bagram (no accountability for who released him)

**Actual Mastermind - Sanullah Ghafari Sarajai:**

**Background:**
- Head of ISIS-KP (Islamic State Khorasan Province) for Pakistan-Afghanistan border region
- 2018-2019: Ran 1,000-member Haqqani Network cell in Kabul
- Very close to Sirajuddin Haqqani

**The Deal (Doha Agreement Context):**
- Sirajuddin to Sanullah: "When Doha deal is in place, as Haqqani Network I can no longer do suicide attacks and bombings per the agreement. I need a way to still commit attacks. Will you join ISIS?"
- Sanullah agreed
- Became "plant in ISIS"
- Quickly became ISIS-KP head for Kabul due to his network

### ISIS-KP Leadership Raid

**March 2020:** ISIS-KP Shura meeting in Kandahar raided by Commando, Sami Sadat

**Captured:**
- 38 people arrested
- All senior ISIS-KP leadership
- Four Russian women (Adams notes: flight attendant once told her "only white people who come to Quetta are Russian prostitutes" - connects to terrorists bringing prostitutes while claiming to stone women for adultery)

**Previous Leader:** Osama Farooqi
- Founded ISIS-KP
- Pakistani
- Came from Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
- Now in prison

**Sanullah's Rise:**
- After leadership captured, ISIS-KP deferred to Sanullah (had most fighters under him in Kabul)
- Became leader of ISIS-KP
- **Critical fact: ISIS-KP leader is a Haqqani plant**

### Abbey Gate Attack Execution

**External Security:** Haqqani Network controlled all external perimeter checkpoints at airport

**Access:** Suicide bomber went through Haqqani Network checkpoints

**The Promise:** "You get the green light, you can use all our networks"

**Anyone acting like this was just an ISIS-KP attack when led by Haqqani plant is a huge disconnect**

**Current U.S. Policy:** U.S. now aligned with Haqqani Network

**Relationship Status:**
- Sirajuddin Haqqani has "very strong feelings" for Sanullah
- Sanullah has "gone off and done a lot of his own" since Abbey Gate
- Relationship close enough that "Sirajuddin is not going to kill Sanullah Ghafari"

**Adams to Families:** "I really hope the families understand this issue. The other piece is..."

### Abbey Gate - The Plotter

**Abdullah Omar Bhajauri:**
- Currently head of intel for ISIS-KP
- "Guy who puts all the pieces together to make an attack happen"
- Another target they should pursue for Abbey Gate
- "We don't even hear his name brought up"

**Adams:** "If we're talking about justice for Abbey Gate, no one's even talking about the key people we need to be taking out. I don't even know if there's active efforts to go after these people."

### ISIS Leadership Structure

**Real ISIS (Iraq/Syria):** Starting in 2020, relocated to Pakistan-Afghanistan border region

**Move to Beluchistan, Pakistan:**

**Location:** Panjgur area

**Strategic Reasons:**
1. Access to sea through Beluchistan
2. Balochi people very supportive about attacks on Iran
3. ISIS wanted to focus more on Iran
4. Balochi in that area have Iranian, Pakistani, AND Afghan citizenship
   - Can move freely between three countries
   - Run all routes in area
   - Unlike others who would be restricted

**2020 Test:** Sent 200 people to test if location safe

**Result:** Declared safe, began moving all senior ISIS leadership

**Current Status:** All ISIS committees based in Panjgur:
- Shura committee
- Operational committee
- Leadership committee
- Media committee

**De Facto Head:** Sanullah Ghafari (the Haqqani plant) now effectively leads all real ISIS

**Adams:** "Isis would allow this to occur - craziest thing ever"

**Syria/Iraq:** Approximately 5,000 ISIS fighters remain

**Iraq/Syria Fighters:** Many now are new Al-Qaeda trainees coming in (people attribute attacks to ISIS but actually Al-Qaeda)

### ISIS-KP Headquarters and Camps

**Headquarters:** Kunar Province, Afghanistan

**Camps:** All ISIS-KP training camps located in Pakistan

**Largest Camp:** Turbat, Pakistan (Baluchistan)
- Named Rozi (after hometown of ISIS-KP founder Osama Farooqi)
- **Protected by Pakistan's Frontier Corps** (branch of Pakistani military, equivalent to National Guard moved to border)

**Frontier Corps Problem:**
- Also provides security at embassies in Pakistan (on streets around embassy enclave when Adams served there)
- Now infiltrated by ISIS-KP
- Harboring ISIS-KP
- Working with ISIS-KP
- **Huge insider threat concern** for protecting Americans and foreigners in Pakistan

### ISIS-KP Size and Composition

**Total:** Approximately 7,000 fighters (2022 number, likely higher now)

**Original Composition:**
- 70% from Afghan Taliban and Pakistani Taliban (TTP)
- 15-20% Central Asians (Tajiks, etc.)

**Central Asian Influx:**
- Joined ISIS by fighting in Syria
- As Syria operations wind down, not returning to Central Asia
- Not senior enough for Beluchistan leadership positions
- Joining ISIS-KP instead

**Public Perception Problem:**
- Moscow attack had four Tajiks
- People concluded "it's a Tajik organization"
- Taliban and Al-Qaeda worried about Russia
- Started spinning propaganda: "ISIS-KP is Tajik organization, Central Asian organization, not Afghan"

**Reality:** Run by Afghan (Sanullah Ghafari grew up in Kabul)

**Pakistan Operations:**
- Most ISIS presence in Pakistan, not Afghanistan
- Very "hush hush"
- Sanullah left Kunar for Panjgur days before interview (believed Russians don't know ISIS senior leadership is in Panjgur)

**Strikes on ISIS in Pakistan:** Only one ever - by Iran

**Iran Strike:**
- Early 2024
- Response to suicide bombing at Qasem Soleimani 4-year memorial (90 killed)
- Iran struck Panjgur trying to hit ISIS
- Missed
- Hit another compound
- Publicly claimed targeting "Jaish al-Adl" to cover missed strike

### Taliban vs. ISIS

**Taliban GDI (Taliban CIA) Response:**
- Supposed to hunt ISIS with U.S. funding
- **Only goes after ISIS if ISIS impacts Taliban**

**Taliban Split - Two Warring Factions:**

1. **Haqqani Side:**
   - Led by Sirajuddin Haqqani

2. **Kandahari Taliban Side:**
   - Hibatullah Akhundzada (head of Taliban)
   - Mullah Yaqub (Mullah Omar's son)
   - Mullah Baradar

**ISIS-KP Targeting:** Mostly attacks Kandahari Taliban side

**Haqqani Attacks:** Only maybe one attack "near building Sirajuddin worked in" - questionable if actually targeting Haqqani

**Nuance:** ISIS-KP not attacking all Taliban, only one faction

**Why Taliban Keeps ISIS Active:**
- Need ISIS to remain threat
- Keeps U.S. "ISIS dollars" flowing in
- As long as ISIS is threat, Taliban continues receiving payment to fight them

### GDI (Taliban Intelligence) - The Real Problem

**Currently Holding:** Two Americans hostage (U.S. lies about this)

**Publicly Known:** Ryan Corbett

**Hidden:** Cell mate - another American, never made public

**Third American:** Held separately, also not made public

**Taliban Total:** Holding three Americans

**State Department:** Told families "don't say publicly, we're going to negotiate"

**Family Response:** Finally went public when State Department failed

**U.S. Paying:** Weekly payments to organization holding Americans "locked in their basement"

**Health Crisis:**
- British detainee released, almost died of sepsis
- Said two Americans kept him alive
- Not getting adequate food or nutrition
- Organs breaking down, brain affected
- Both Americans "suffering severe health consequences"

**Adams:** "We should not be giving a penny to the organization holding Americans in their basement"

### GDI Structure and Operations

**Different Departments with Different Functions:**

**"Immigrants Department":**
- Solely funds and supports Pakistani Taliban (TTP)
- TTP doing all Pakistan attacks now
- GDI unit just supports them

**Taliban Tactic - Rotating Units:**
- Rotating Taliban units into TTP for Pakistan attacks
- Conducted 800 attacks in Pakistan last year
- Completely resurged into "one of biggest terrorist groups in region"
- When Pakistani military kills attackers and identifies Afghan Taliban, dismissed as "you always blame Afghans"
- Part of Fat War plan
- Nobody realizes it's Afghan Taliban doing attacks

**TTP Background:**
- Attacked Americans
- Marriott bombing killed Americans
- Peshawar consulate attack

**12th Department - Most Important:**
- **Sole job:** Protect Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan

**12th Department Functions:**
1. Protect all 30 Al-Qaeda training camps
2. Vet all new recruits (Afghan, Jordanian, Syrian, Egyptian) before training
3. Move all new trainees (into camps, between locations)
4. Move Al-Qaeda senior leadership
5. **Harbor senior leadership in their own houses** (know U.S. won't strike GDI due to relationship)
6. Protect Al-Qaeda cash holdings in Afghanistan (very large holdings)
7. Control all border movements for Al-Qaeda

**One unit in GDI, sole job: supporting Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan**

## U.S. Funding of Terrorist Organizations

### Three Buckets of Money

**Bucket 1: Bank Reserves ($7 Billion)**

**Origin:** Government of Afghanistan reserves when it fell (held offshore in U.S.)

**Distribution:**
- $3.5 billion: Allocated to 9/11 victims
  - **Problem:** Adams hasn't met anyone besides lawyers who received money
  - Earning "insane interest monthly"
  - Money location and status unclear
  - "Someone needs to be on this $3.5 billion that U.S. siphoned off"

- $3.5 billion: Moved to Swiss bank account
  - Given to Taliban government
  - Overseen by only 4 people in Switzerland

**Oversight Committee:**
1. State Department officer (Adams: "Should be Treasury or Commerce, not State")
2. Swiss diplomat
3. Afghan finance department head (has appropriate background)
4. Second Afghan - **potential nepotism connection to U.S. Envoy Tom West**

**Tom West Issues:**
- Special Envoy to Afghanistan
- "Lots of issues involving him"
- Taliban sympathizer
- After Kabul fall said: **"We will do anything at all cost to recognize the Taliban"**
- "This is the broker we have"

**Account Status:**
- Already earned over $180 million in interest
- Mixed reports on whether Sirajuddin has taken money
- Some say payments to Uzbekistan for electricity bills came from this account

**Uzbekistan Context:**
- June 2021 (before Kabul fall): U.S. military told pilots "in case of emergency fly planes to Uzbekistan"
- All those planes still sitting in Uzbekistan
- Taliban wants planes back
- Taliban paying off debts to Uzbekistan to get planes returned
- **Message:** "Uzbekistan, Pakistan - don't give the planes back"

**Adams:** "That's that, $3.5 billion Taliban has access to" (meant to say billion, corrected)

### Bucket 2: Weekly Plane Delivery ($40-87 Million)

**The Plane:**
- Arrives weekly in Afghanistan
- Publicly stated as "$40 million a week"

**Actual Amount:** $43 million to $87 million per week (large discrepancy)

**Process:**
1. Money taken from plane
2. Brought to Afghanistan International Bank (making huge money from exchange of this volume)
3. Supposedly distributed to humanitarian aid

**Reality:** 70% siphoned off to Taliban-only causes, majority to Taliban military

**Taliban Siphoning Methods:**

1. **Basic Bribes:** Doesn't account for 70%

2. **Board Membership Requirement:** Every NGO collecting from this fund must have Taliban representative on board (complete control of money distribution)

3. **NGO Infiltration:**
   - Long-standing NGOs with State Department relationships
   - Taliban "gutted them completely, put all Taliban in them"
   - State Department claims "12-year relationship, good record"
   - Not being honest: "None of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"

**Critical Issue - Taliban Martyr Payments:**

**U.S. paying welfare to Taliban martyr families**
- Every Taliban member who died fighting U.S. forces
- U.S. government paying stipend to family
- American Gold Star families "aren't getting squat"

**Justification Given:** "One person gave answer: 'It'll stop them from joining ISIS'"

**Adams' Response:** "The Taliban guy is already dead"

**Adams:** "We should not be giving a penny" to this

### Bucket 3: ISIS Dollars (Classified Amount)

**Source:** Secret annexes on Doha deal never released

**Adams:** "Congress needs to release them because it's time we know what they say"

**The Money Trail - Eight Delivery Stops:**

Adams team "followed the money" - money from plane doesn't all go to Afghan International Bank, goes to eight other destinations weekly

#### Stop 1: Prime Minister of Taliban
**Mohammad Hassan Akhund**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. and international law)
- Got position as longtime Mullah Omar supporter
- Publicly backs Hibatullah
- **Privately:** Very wealthy from Taliban funds, heavy investments in Pakistan
- Natural leanings toward Pakistanis due to financial investments
- Playing "two-faced" - Taliban and Pakistan
- Fall-back plan: Pakistan supports him if pushed out
- **Status:** Won't remain in position - Hibatullah trying to move him out, wants chief of staff instead
- Has cancer, going to Pakistan for treatment (educated/good doctors fled Afghanistan)

#### Stop 2: Deputy Prime Minister
**Mullah Baradar**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. and international law)
- Went to Iran and made deal with Iranians and Al-Qaeda
- Deal: Send Al-Qaeda fighters to attack U.S. and Israeli troops
- **Huge violation of Doha deal**

**Historical Doha Deal Violations:**
- Mark Frerichs detained by Taliban before Kabul fall
- Special Envoy Ross Wilson (before Tom West, "just as bad as West") knew Taliban detained Mark
- Downplayed to keep "fake peace deal" going: "No, it's not Taliban, it's people trying to ruin peace"
- Taliban had him whole time
- After Kabul fall: Released Frerichs for **number one narco trafficker in Afghanistan** that Taliban runs
- "State Department lied and downplayed to keep Doha deal going"

#### Stop 3: GDI (General Directorate of Intelligence)
**Abdul Haq Wasiq**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. and international law)
- Released for Bowe Bergdahl
- Runs Taliban CIA
- Department structure discussed earlier (immigrants dept funds TTP, 12th dept protects Al-Qaeda)
- **Holds two Americans in cell**

#### Stop 4: Ministry of Interior
**Sirajuddin Haqqani**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. and international law)
- Where Musa makes passports for terrorists
- Uses biometrics left behind to hunt U.S. allies

#### Stop 5: Sirajuddin Haqqani's House
**Direct delivery to personal residence**
- "This man sent 1,500 suicide bombers at us and NATO troops"
- "Over 1,000 suicide bombers sent by him alone"
- **"U.S. is dropping cash off at his house weekly"**
- "Mind-blowing"

#### Stop 6: Head of Taliban
**Hibatullah Akhundzada**
- Supreme religious leader (like Mullah Omar)
- Making "so much bank - several million dollars"
- **Not the double-dipper** (that was prime minister)
- Gets stipend from Iranians
- Gets stipend from Russians
- Gets money from Indians
- Controls Chinese money ($10 billion investments)

#### Stop 7: Al-Qaeda Military Commission
**Saif al-Adel**
- Runs Al-Qaeda military commission
- **De facto head of Al-Qaeda external operations** (planning attacks against U.S.)
- **U.S. government lies and says he's head of Al-Qaeda**
- Even if that were true, "still paying weekly the head of Al-Qaeda"

#### Stop 8: The Top Three of Al-Qaeda
**The Bin Laden Brothers:**

1. **Hamza Bin Laden** - Number One
   - **Designated terrorist**
   - "Wanted in mid's life"
   - True leader of Al-Qaeda

2. **Saad Bin Laden** - Number Two
   - Deputy leader of Al-Qaeda

3. **Abdullah Bin Laden** - Number Three
   - **Not designated** - "only terrorist we legally can give money to"
   - **Adams:** "Please designate Abdullah Bin Laden as a terrorist"
   - COO role - runs business operations side of Al-Qaeda

**Structure:**
- Hamza: Overall leader
- Saad: Deputy
- Abdullah: Business operations
- Saif al-Adel: Fighting operations

**All four senior leaders of Al-Qaeda receive U.S. cash deliveries from airplane**

**Summary:** "Every single delivery except one was a building, every single one of those terrorists are sanctioned, every delivery is against U.S. law"

### Why U.S. Continues Funding

**Adams' Theories:**
1. **Terror sympathizing problem**
2. **Incompetence**
3. **Money laundering** - "People make money off of it, is an incentive, people care about money more than country"
4. **Politics** - "People care about politics more than country"
5. **No accountability** - "No one will be honest and say this is wrong, fix it"
6. **Partisanship** - "Well if my party is doing it, maybe it's wrong but at least it's my party and that's better than someone else doing it"

**Adams:** "We're in a very divided country but it's both parties doing this. They're benefiting by dividing us and we participate in it every time we allude to it or die on a hill for one of these losers representing us."

## Libya and Regional Terrorism

### Current Al-Qaeda Status in Libya

**Deal with Libyan Government:** Al-Qaeda will not attack inside Libya

**Result:** "Nobody really knows Al-Qaeda in Libya exists right now"

**Operations:** Running purely as business in Libya, helping Al-Qaeda elsewhere:
- Trying to step into Mali
- Fund different parts of Al-Qaeda around world
- Fund ISIS

**Smart Strategy:** Terrorists following Taliban model - "if we're political organization we won't be targeted, or targeting will be limited"

**Rebranding:** Al-Qaeda renamed to **"Islamic Reform Movement"** trying to appear as political group vs. terrorist group

### Abdul Hakim Belhaj

**Profile:**
- "Kind of one of the most famous Libyan terrorists"
- "Pretty much only terrorist most people know"
- People ask: "Why isn't he in Benghazi investigation?" Answer: "Because he wasn't an attacker"
- **Al-Qaeda point man**
- Leading restructuring efforts
- When Haqqani delegation comes to Libya, they work with Belhaj
- Former CIA black sites detainee
- **Runs an airline**
- Aligned with Government of Libya
- **U.S. aligned with same Government of Libya**

**U.S. Position:** "We are on same side as Islamic Reform Movement in Libya"

**Government Position:** "U.S. government will downplay him, I don't even know if he's designated as terrorist anymore. They will downplay and say he's not Al-Qaeda when he is the head of Al-Qaeda right now in Libya."

### Ashraf Salton - Eastern Libya Al-Qaeda Head

**Background:**
- Head of Al-Qaeda in eastern Libya
- Former GMO (Guantanamo) detainee
- 2012 Benghazi attacker

**Haqqani Connection:**
- Haqqani reached out to Salton
- Discussion: "We want to repeat the success of Afghanistan in Tripoli"
- Part of plan to make "little Taliban-stans" everywhere
- Goal: "Huge Islamic Emirate"
- "Really big goal, kind of Osama bin Laden's old goals, now next generation trying to do them"

### Weapons Trade

**Libya as Weapons Hub:**
- One of best places in world to buy weapons
- **Not 2011-2012 Gaddafi stockpiles** - terrorists don't buy 15-20 year old weapons
- Buying brand new weapons

**Sources:**
1. **Serbia**
2. **Ukraine**
3. **Turkey**

**Ukraine Weapons:**
- Weapons from Ukraine definitely reaching Libya
- Unknown if specifically U.S.-provided weapons
- Could be from either side (both Ukraine and Russia have weapons there)
- "Corruption on both sides"

**Haqqani Weapons Purchase:**
- Haqqani Network delegation from Afghanistan to Libya to get weapons
- **Questions:**
  - Are Al-Qaeda giving weapons for free (since they're rich and Al-Qaeda doesn't charge Al-Qaeda)?
  - Are they buying non-U.S. origin weapons?

**Context:** Pakistan complaints about TTP having M4s, M16s, U.S. gear - some marked "Property of US Government"
- Creates flak on Taliban
- Haqqani going to Libya may be to get different origin weapons

**Weapons Purchased:**
- Russian PKT heavy machine guns
- 150mm and 160mm artillery shells
- Large supplies, not one-man portable

### Libya-Hamas Connection (Historical to Present)

**1911 Origins:**

**Omar al-Mukhtar:**
- Libyan Revolution hero (1911 against Italians)
- Izz ad-Din al-Qassam fought with al-Mukhtar
- Al-Qassam born in Ottoman Empire (Syria), settled in British Mandate Palestine
- **Al-Qassam Brigades** (conducted October 2023 Hamas attacks) named after him
- Libyan-Palestinian terrorism relationship dates to 1911

**1972 Munich Olympics:**
- Gaddafi funded part of Olympic Village attack against Israeli athletes (Black September)
- Gaddafi buried dead Black September terrorists in Tripoli (they remain there now)

**Recent Hamas Attacks Context:**

**Zaari (Libyan-Tunisian):**
- Real name not public, only Kunia (nom de guerre) known
- Created drone program for Hamas
- Close to Benghazi attackers including Wasam Bin Hamid

**Hamas Cell in Libya:**
- Ran by Wasam Bin Hamid and Ahmed Abu Khattala (fake mastermind)
- Organization moved weapons and aid to Hamas in Gaza over years
- Book includes picture of Abu Khattala in Gaza around 2011

**Wasam Bin Hamid:**
- Mastermind of Benghazi mortar attack (killed U.S. personnel)
- When killed, **Abu Obediah** (now famous Hamas spokesperson) posted on defunct Twitter:
- "This hero was number one supplier of weapons to al-Qassam Brigades"
- **Benghazi attacker no one went after was Hamas' number one weapons supplier**

**Kalas Shikshak:**
- Another terrorist from black sites
- After 2011 Libyan Revolution made "Libyan National Guard"
- **U.S. government got into relationship with him**
- **Used as cover/front to buy new weapons for Hamas**
- Worked with Marwan Issa (Hamas representative sent from Gaza to Libya)
- Marwan had National Guard ID card "like he's Libyan, so he could carry weapons in Libya"
- Would buy weapons as National Guard, send to Gaza

**Marwan Issa Detention:**
- Libyan government detained him 2016 due to large criminal enterprise
- Released December 2023 (after October Gaza attacks) by Prime Minister Dbeibah
- "All over press" because Dbeibah released them
- Got private plane from Tripoli to Qatar

**Adams' Regret:** "When we put book out we went back and forth how much Hamas to include because it'll throw people off - they don't understand connectivity, keep Al-Qaeda and Hamas separate. We only touched on it. In retrospect, we should have explained this more. When I say Al-Qaeda training Hamas in Afghanistan people think it sounds crazy - this relationship is going on really long time, you just didn't collect it that way so you ignore it exists."

### U.S. Embassy Plans for Tripoli

**State Department Request:** $53 million for new embassy in Tripoli

**Context:**
- City where 75% of at-large Benghazi attackers harbored by Government of Libya
- Government U.S. is aligned with

**Meanwhile:** FBI says "no budget for bounties"
- Adams requested $1 million bounty on Hamza al-Darsi
- FBI: no money available

**Adams:** "Plenty of money to put embassy in but not any money to go after terrorists who are going to attack that embassy when you put it in. Craziest thinking ever."

## The Bin Laden Family and Al-Qaeda Leadership

### Why U.S. Lies About Hamza's Death

**2019:** Hamza Bin Laden reported dead in strike

**5 Months Later:** Afghan officials reportedly found he didn't die, provided picture to U.S. government
- Where picture went, who received it: unknown at time

**People Trying to Reveal Truth:**
**September 2021:** Person who ensured information got out that Hamza is alive was **"captured, tortured, and killed by Taliban"**

**Adams:** "Good people trying to get this information out on Taliban and they're dying for it, and we're still lying about who's heading the Taliban while people are dying trying to tell us - this is huge problem."

### The Reconciliation Context (Why Death Narrative Needed)

**2010:** Adams stopped working Taliban - "train left station"
- Taliban reconciliation happening
- State Department "going to make it happen at all costs"
- All intel collection focused on reconciliation, not terrorist activities

**The Problem:** One thing could stop peace deal - if it benefits the Bin Ladens

**Political Reality:** Any U.S. leader showing up at 9/11 memorial "never going to make a deal with Al-Qaeda"

**Adams:** "There's something about Hamza Bin Laden that he was better dead"

**Critical Caveat:** "I hate saying this because I honestly don't think the President knew and it's going to be a big problem"

### The Family Connections

**Hamza's Four Wives:**

**Second Wife:** Everyone knows - daughter of Abu Muhammad al-Masri (video released)
- Abu Muhammad al-Masri now head of Al-Qaeda in Africa (thought dead, Israelis killed wrong person in Iran)

**First Wife (Married just before second wife):** **Daughter of Mullah Omar**

**Marriage Details:**
- Married since Hamza was 17 years old
- Five years after 9/11
- **Therefore: Any peace deal with Taliban was also peace deal with Bin Ladens - they are married to each other**

### The Next Generation

**Hamza's Son:** Osama Bin Laden (named after grandfather)

**Everyone Assumes:** Osama is Miriam's son (Abu Muhammad al-Masri's daughter)

**Therefore:** Next heir to Al-Qaeda is grandson of:
- **Osama bin Laden** AND
- **Mullah Omar**

**Critical Conclusion:** "Our peace deal with Taliban was with the Bin Ladens"

**No Way to Give Things to Taliban Without Also Going to Bin Ladens:** "They're the same family, they don't just work together"

### Mullah Omar Background Refresher

**Creation of Taliban:**
- 1990s: Six men got together including:
  - Muhammad Hassan Akhund (prime minister, first delivery recipient, cancer patient)
  - Mullah Omar

**Reasoning (almost makes sense):**
- After Mujahedin era and Soviet war ended, Afghanistan was "criminal landscape"
- No one in charge, no law and order, so much crime
- "We're going to create Taliban, bring law and order, safety, protect women" (by locking them up)

**Mullah Omar:**
- Created Taliban
- Gave Osama bin Laden refuge in Afghanistan
- 9/11 planned from Afghanistan

### Current Bin Laden Plans

**Their Goals:**

1. **Retaliation for Father:** "Do want to do something in retaliation for their father" - specifics unknown

2. **Intimately Involved:** Syria and Iraq deployments (10,000 Al-Qaeda sent at Iran's request)

3. **Fat War Plan:** Bin Ladens, Taliban, Al-Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent, JUI political party in Pakistan all together

4. **Complete Father's Unfinished Goals:**
   - Create larger caliphate
   - Create actual base in Africa (father wanted Libya, started in Benghazi)
   - Mali as next Al-Qaeda base

5. **Islamic Army:**
   - Father's vision: United front against West
   - Don't care if Sunni or Shia
   - Want to bring even ISIS in
   - Slowly working on relationships to form this army

**Historical Attempts:**
- Bin Laden tried in Benghazi (took couple years post his death)
- **Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council** - made couple branches
- Tried again, called it **Islamic Army** in eastern Libya
- "Same then groups didn't stay together, became Isis, Al-Qaeda fought, became nightmare"
- Leaders "disappeared, Libyan National Army didn't kill them, they're like in the wind, don't even know where, potentially could be in Afghanistan"

**Long-term Goal:** "Giant Islamic Army of like-minded terrorist groups, but that's a little longer out"

### Big Event Planning

**Shawn Ryan:** "Do you think there's a big event planned like September 11th?"

**Adams:**
- Some smaller things (embassy attacks)
- Whatever Bin Ladens want for father "probably going to have to elevate it to that level, at least attempt to"

**Already Have Win:** Got Afghanistan

**Want More for Father:**

**But Consider:**
- More fighters now than 20 years ago
- More money now
- Have whole country
- U.S. ignores them
- Won't admit they're there or resurging
- Won't even say who leader is
- "We basically cover for their activities"
- Lie about some attacks in Iraq/Syria being Iranian proxies when they're Al-Qaeda
- "Just like they lied about Al-Qaeda in Benghazi, some attacks in Iraq and Syria they're like 'Iranian proxies' - no, some are Al-Qaeda. Need to say if they're Al-Qaeda that they're Al-Qaeda."

**Adams:** "I just don't understand why they're covering for them, why we're financing them"

### Al-Qaeda Power Comparison

**More Powerful Now Than Pre-9/11:** Definitely yes

**More Powerful Than Al-Qaeda in Iraq Was:** Uncertain - "Al-Qaeda in Iraq got very powerful, that was huge resurgence"

**Will Surpass:** "They're going to surpass that, that's their goal"

**Prediction:** "Al-Qaeda will be the biggest it's ever been in next year. I have no doubts."

**Current vs. ISIS:**
- ISIS (all locations combined): ~20,000 members
- Al-Qaeda (30 camps): 100,000 new trained recruits by end of year
- Taliban (last 2 years): 170,000 new military recruits

## International Connections and Supply Lines

### China-Afghanistan Relationship

**$10 Billion Investment:**

**Key Fact:** "$3 of every $10 gets allocated to Al-Qaeda" = **$3 billion to Al-Qaeda**

**Distribution:**
- Al-Qaeda keeps some
- Gives some to affiliates: TTP and IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan)

**IMU:** Another group sending terrorists to U.S. southern border

**Beyond Lithium - The Real Strategy:**

**China-Iran Oil Deal:**
- If U.S. comes to war with China "and shit hits the fan"
- China will get oil from Iran
- **Afghanistan will be used as land route for Iranian oil**
- China worried U.S. will cut off oil supplies from South America or Africa
- Land route insurance

**Bagram Air Base:**
- "One of more key strategic bases in world"
- Now where **Chinese PMCs (private military contractors) are based**

### India-Taliban-Pakistan Triangle

**$10 Million Indian Payment to Mullah Yaqub:** Funded Bagram base

**Bagram Use:** Where Hibatullah's (supreme Taliban leader) personal security is based

**Adams' Questions:**
- "Indian government or intel service funding Hibatullah's personal security - isn't that weird?"
- Not even tons of money compared to U.S. funding
- "What is India getting? What's Taliban getting? They don't give a damn about $10 million"

**The Craziest Thing Ever:**

**India is using Taliban networks to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan**

**Adams:** "I swear to God, I know this leaves so many questions"

**Operations:**
- Killing Kashmir militants all over Pakistan (Lahore, Karachi, etc.)
- Also killing Sikh militants (Adams doesn't know details of Sikh aspect)

**18 Targeted for Assassination:**
- Adams went through all 18 to verify who they were
- Groups: Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen
- **Not one from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen** - this is key

### The Theory - Kashmir Future War Plan

**Hibatullah Connection:**
- Religious teaching from **Fazal Rahman Khalil** (founded Hizb-ul-Mujahideen)
- Still close friends
- Hibatullah gives U.S. money to HuM and their madrassas

**Adams' Theory:**
- Taliban and HuM decided to work together
- Use India to eliminate Kashmir militants aligned to Pakistan
- India doesn't understand this is what's happening or why they're invested

**The Problem:**
- Kashmir militants are Pakistani nationalists
- Pakistan loyalists
- Can't be used in Fat War plan or future Kashmir war plan

**Old Guard vs. New Guard:**
- Taking out old guard of Kashmir militant leaders
- New generation of Kashmir militants after training in Kashmir fought in Afghanistan
- Fought with Taliban against Americans
- **New generation more aligned to Taliban and Al-Qaeda than Pakistani military**

**Creating New Landscape:**
- "Creating this whole new Kashmir landscape nobody has thought about and nobody's ready for"
- Will be ready in future when war plan moves to Kashmir
- "Taliban and Al-Qaeda have thought this far ahead"

**Strategic Thinking:**
- China thinks in 100 years
- U.S. has people work on account for 1-2 years
- "We aren't prepared to deal with threats the way they're doing it"

## Treatment of Afghan Allies

### The Numbers

**200,000 Total:** Afghan military and police who worked with U.S.

**Killed:** Just over 10,000 (in 2.5 years)
- Context: Under 2,500 Americans died in 20+ years of war
- 10,000 Afghan allies in 2.5 years

**Captured:** 30,000
- 18,000 went through "fake justice system" (Taliban Sharia Court)
- Prison sentence or executed
- **12,000 completely missing**

**Missing Allies:** 12,000 status unknown (dead, being tortured, in secret prisons)

**Secret Prisons:**
- GDI has secret prisons
- Ministry of Interior has secret prison
- Ministry of Defense has secret prisons
- Secret prison in Bagram base
- Secret prison in Helmand

**Total Missing Afghans:** 70,000 (including non-allies)
- Disappeared when Taliban came
- Never seen again
- Families never notified

### How They're Being Found - Biometrics

**U.S. Left Behind:** Complete biometric database

**Location:** Ministry of Interior building

**Taliban Strategy:**
- Taken property, homes, businesses, land
- Cut power (some cut 2 years ago, refuse to restore)
- Example: Police officer had power cut, Taliban won't restore "they want to put power back on his house"

**Initial Period:** First year Taliban didn't really have biometrics working
- Faked it (like theme park annual pass fake fingerprint reader to dissuade sharing)

**Chinese and Iranian Help:** Got system working and deployed on mobile devices

**Current Deployment:** Border crossings and checkpoints

**Warning to Afghans:** "If you went through border crossing 6 months after fall and you were fine, don't assume you're fine now - they didn't have it working then even though they pretended, now they do"

**Databases Working:**
- Entire passport database
- Entire criminal database
- Entire police system for Ministry of Interior and Afghan Army
- Entire pay system for NDS (Afghan CIA)
- Entire pay system for Supreme Court

**Targeting Method:** Using pay systems to find allies - "they know they have right guy because it's tied back to their damn payroll"

**Adams:** "Can change your name but doesn't matter - they'll take your fingerprint and say 'we know exactly who you are'"

"Greatest case of targeting I've ever seen. They're doing it successfully, they're allowed to, they're getting away with it."

**How Long:** Fully running for at least 6 months (since finding Musa)

**Assessment:** "These guys don't have a chance. We left them for the slaughter."

### Women

**Reported Rapes (last 2.5 years):**
- 880,000 women
- 15,000 children

**Note:** These are people capable of reporting - most are "prisoners in their own house and can't even get out and say something has happened"

**Torture Videos:** Taliban sending to Americans

**Parliamentary Representation:**
- When Afghanistan fell: 27% women in Parliament
- United States: 29%
- "Got to a point in 20 years equal par to us"

**Current Status:** Zero rights, living in prison

**U.S. Promise:** "You're going to be doctors and lawyers"

**U.S. Action:** "We are doing nothing for their women, just like we did nothing for women of Iran"

"Against all human rights thoughts like you could even imagine"

### Future U.S. Operations

**Will Afghans Partner With Americans Again?**

**Adams:** "I think they will because a lot of my information comes from people still willing to partner with Americans"

**Should Not Use U.S. Troops on Ground:**
- Lost in Afghanistan because of U.S. policy
- U.S. policy not going to change to "fight better war against terrorism"
- See this with how U.S. trying to dictate Israel's war
- "U.S. not going to go and eliminate terrorist group in Afghanistan - we just don't have it in us"
- Watched it in East Libya: "General Haftar did it the way he needed to do it and was very successful, but that is not way Americans are going to do it"

**Should Support:**
- Anti-Taliban resistance
- Pakistani military (but need to deal with major issues first)

**Pakistan Problem:**
- Almost stuck with only lever being ISIS
- "Isis is not lever - no good comes from any government who uses Isis against other groups"
- Need to take money from Taliban and ISIS, give to resistance in Pakistan
- Need to break Pakistan giving ISIS safe haven

**Historical Problem:**
- All those years fighting in Afghanistan, terrorists fell back to Pakistan
- Captured and killed some there
- Still a safe haven
- Even if funding resistance like Ukraine to go in, if terrorists fall back to Pakistan and can't be actioned, "we get back to same situation"
- "Have to keep terrorists contained in Afghanistan and get them in Afghanistan"

**Root of Problem:**
- Got into mess with Pakistan funding old Mujahedin against Soviets
- "Only way out and only way to deal with insane terrorist safe haven is we got to deal with Pakistan"
- Must do it with anti-Taliban resistance
- Must get anti-Taliban resistance in Pakistan to say "water under bridge, lot of bad history, but future is worse, we have to work together"

"I think that's going to be any future of success"

### Benghazi Terrorists in Afghanistan

**Confirmed:** Locations confirmed

**Musa:** Found and proven making passports

**Others:** "In the hopper that we think are going to move to Afghanistan, working on them"

**Key Players:** Some probably taking senior leadership roles in Al-Qaeda

### Second Generation Problem

**Context:** Benghazi attacks were 2012

**Examples:**
- **Abu Yahya al-Libi:** Killed terrorist, has sons now - where are they?
- **Abu Faraj al-Libi:** Senior terrorist, where are sons?
- **Abu Anas al-Libi:** Planner of Kenya/Tanzania embassy attacks, captured in Libya, his son now Al-Qaeda

**Second Generation:**
- If didn't grow up in Afghanistan, now want to move there
- Want to do what fathers did
- Move up ranks
- Be this next generation of Al-Qaeda
- **Being completely ignored**

**Example - Not Benghazi Attacker:**
- Second-generation Al-Qaeda guy running Al-Qaeda in northern Afghanistan
- Key Al-Qaeda commander
- His son "just showed up in Libya this week"
- Son only ever lived in Afghanistan (father moved during Mujahedin era, spent years in Bosnia, Russians captured in Bosnia, locked him up, somehow released)
- "Now what's going on?"

**"Huge gap in second generation of terrorists that I don't think anyone is collecting on"**

---

## Key Individuals and Organizations

### Terrorist Leaders and Operatives

**Hamza Bin Laden**
- Leader of Al-Qaeda

## Recommendations and Solutions

### Stop the Money

**Number One Request from Afghan Resistance:**

Adams: "I thought they would say air support or something. Every single person I talked to in resistance all had exact same answer: **Stop the U.S. money going to Taliban. Period.**"

**Ethical Imperative:**
- Funding Al-Qaeda
- Funding Taliban
- Funding TTP
- Funding people who have Americans in basement
- "This is insanity"

### Border Security

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Close the border** - "Not that TikTok's bringing them through borders, you're letting them through border"
2. **Stop South American visa policies:**
   - Require visas from China
   - Ecuador must require Chinese visas
   - Pressure countries facilitating travel
3. **Leverage U.S. aid** - these are U.S. southern neighbors receiving aid
4. **Address pipeline further south** - don't wait until border

### Pressure on Pakistan

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Stop ISIS safe haven in Beluchistan**
2. **Deal with Frontier Corps infiltration**
3. **Address TTP and Fat War plan**
4. **Break use of ISIS as lever** - "No good comes from any government who uses ISIS against other groups"
5. **Redirect funding** - take money from Taliban/ISIS, give to resistance in Pakistan

### Support Anti-Taliban Resistance

**Approach:**
- Fund like Ukraine model
- Support anti-Taliban resistance in both Afghanistan and Pakistan
- Must convince Pakistan and Afghan resistance to work together despite bad history
- "Water under bridge, future is worse, we have to work together"

### Do Not Use U.S. Troops on Ground

**Reasoning:**
- U.S. policy won't change to fight better terrorism war
- Lost in Afghanistan due to policy, not capability
- Same as dictating Israel's war
- "Don't have it in us" to eliminate terrorist groups properly
- General Haftar did it successfully in East Libya his way, not American way

### Release Doha Deal Classified Annexes

**Congress Must:**
- Release all secret annexes
- Public needs to know what's in them
- "It's time we know what they say"

### Designations and Accountability

**Immediately Designate:**
- **Abdullah Bin Laden** as terrorist (only one of top 3 Al-Qaeda not designated, only one U.S. legally can give money to)

**Fire/Move Out:**
- Taliban sympathizers in State Department
- People who can't make level-headed decisions
- "Need to fire a lot of people in State Department"

### Intelligence Collection Changes

**Stop Compartmentalizing Terrorist Groups:**
- End "bucket" system (ISIS in ISIS bucket, Al-Qaeda in Al-Qaeda bucket, Hamas ignored)
- Start cross-functional collection
- Track how terrorists share monetary resources, joint training, cross-group operations
- Example: Should have noticed Palestinian terrorists training in Afghanistan before Hamas attacks

**Change Perspective:**
- Stop viewing as org structure
- Understand "wrapped around interconnectedness"
- "We're viewing from almost like Western focus and we don't know how to view it another way but we need to start"

### Biometrics and Afghan Ally Protection

**Immediate Warnings:**
- Inform Afghans that biometric system now working
- If crossed border 6 months after fall and were fine, not necessarily safe now
- System fully operational at all crossings

**Longer Term:**
- Address how this happened
- Accountability for leaving systems behind
- Evacuation of at-risk allies

### Prosecute Real Benghazi Attackers

**Stop Fake Trials:**
- Don't retry Ahmed Abu Khattala (fake mastermind)
- Go after actual mortar team (Adams provided information November 2023, FBI hasn't responded)

**Deport FBI Witness:**
- Remove from U.S. immediately
- Face trial in Libya for war crimes
- Justice for Nasser al-Sani family
- No longer protecting terrorist

**Target Real Masterminds:**
- Focus on those still alive and operational
- Musa (document forger) should be top priority
- "Best Al-Qaeda passport guy in world should have been detained after Benghazi"

### Embassy Security

**Cancel Tripoli Embassy:**
- Don't spend $53 million on embassy in city harboring 75% of at-large Benghazi attackers
- Instead fund bounties on terrorists
- Abu Muhammad al-Masri in Mali threatens Bamako embassy

### Address Muslim Brotherhood

**Ban in America:**
- Already banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE
- Stop lobbying influence
- Stop funding terrorist family court cases
- "We need to ban them in America"

### Campaign Finance Reform

**Adams' View:**
- "Should be some sort of campaign finance laws"
- Current system: person who earns most money for party gets elected
- Creates IOU situations
- "Never going to get best person if you just get best salesman or best fundraiser or best guy that'll pat your back"

### Congressional Action - GWOT Generation

**Adams' Frustration:**
- "We're GWOT generation, have people from our generation in Congress"
- "Going to show up to work tomorrow and be fine that this money going to Taliban"
- "What the hell are they doing? Do your damn jobs. Do the right thing."
- "You're an American, stand up for American ideals"
- "Need to get back to being American, has to be our generation at this point"
- "You're the one that fought in these wars, know exactly what we're talking about, know exactly the people, know exactly what funding them is going to do"

### Women's Rights in Afghanistan

**Context:**
- 27% of Parliament was women when Afghanistan fell
- U.S. is 29%
- "Got to a point in 20 years equal par to us"
- Now zero rights

**Stop Being Manipulated:**
- Haqqani playing women's education card
- Using brother Anas for U.S. relations
- Delaying until gives "crappy terrorist-lite women education"
- U.S. will be exhausted and tell women of Afghanistan to "just settle for that"

**Real Focus:** Haqqani $300 million budget for jihadi madrassas to train 500,000 students

### Information Warfare

**Newsletter/Media:**
- Adams contributing intel briefs to Shawn Ryan Show newsletter
- "Major problem getting information out on what terrorists doing right now"
- Public needs access to real intelligence

### Stop Covering for Terrorists

**Honesty in Attribution:**
- Stop calling Al-Qaeda attacks "Iranian proxies" in Iraq/Syria
- "Need to say if they're Al-Qaeda that they're Al-Qaeda"
- Just like lied about Al-Qaeda in Benghazi
- Stop covering for bin Ladens' activities
- Admit who's really leading Al-Qaeda (Hamza)

### Justice System Reforms

**Stop Misuse:**
- Terrorist families using U.S. courts against counterterrorism operators
- General Haftar being sued for operations against terrorists who attacked U.S.
- War crimes claims against legitimate counterterrorism operations
- This is enabled by not banning Muslim Brotherhood

### Tell President the Truth

**Adams:** "Tell your president the truth - I think that should be rule one"

**Critical Truths:**
- Hamza Bin Laden is alive
- Peace deal was with Bin Ladens (married to Taliban)
- Weekly cash going to designated terrorists
- Al-Qaeda more powerful than ever
- Bigger than pre-9/11
- Will be biggest ever within next year

---

## Closing

**Shawn Ryan to Audience:**
- "Like, comment, subscribe"
- "Most importantly share this everywhere you possibly can"
- Leave reviews on Apple and Spotify

**Adams' Primary Message:**
"Every single person I talked to in the resistance all had the exact same answer: Stop the U.S. money going to the Taliban. Period."

**Adams' Hope:**
"I don't want to drop anything. I want people to go after these terrorists finally so I can retire. I'm getting old too."

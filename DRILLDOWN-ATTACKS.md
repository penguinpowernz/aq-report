## Syrian Christian Persecution (November 2024 - Present)

### Scale of Killings

**Reported Numbers:**
- "In the thousands"
- Exact numbers very limited due to terrorist-run government
- Only seeing "maybe 10% of the numbers"
- Most deaths unreported

**Comparison to Syrian Civil War:**
- Over 500,000 Syrians died during civil war under Assad
- U.S. and press ignored those deaths
- Now acting concerned when terrorist doing the killings
- "These atrocities have been going on for a long time in Syria"

### Methods of Execution

**ISIS-Style Killings:**
- Beheadings
- Executions
- Bodies dumped in rivers
- Children put in cages and drowned in river
- Women taken as sex slaves
- "Unimaginable level of horror"

**Burning Alive:**
- Putting people in cages
- Setting them on fire
- Same methods ISIS used in Iraq against Christians

**Systematic Targeting:**
- Going through demographic group by group
- Alawite neighborhoods hit
- Christian communities targeted
- Kurds being attacked

### Syrian Disarmament Trap

**Registration Scheme:**
- Julani required weapons be turned in
- Required registration
- "Be part of this new democracy, this inclusive government"

**Results:**
- Christians and Alawites turned in weapons
- West was pushing this narrative
- Think tanks in US urged Kurds to turn in weapons

**Kurdish Response:**
- Kurds refused to turn in weapons
- Still armed and defending themselves
- Still being attacked by Turkish government
- But not defenseless like other groups

**War Predicted:**
- "Going to end up being some sort of larger war"
- Kurds will not give weapons to terrorists
- Still have capability to resist

### Taliban Members Leading Killings

**Legend's Intelligence:**
> "There are Taliban fighters in Syria, there are Taliban members that supported Julani during his takeover of Syria just a few months ago and there are Taliban fighters in Syria right now currently at the moment"

**Religious Minorities Targeted:**
- Christians being slaughtered daily
- Alawites (another minority in country)
- Not just Christians - many Muslims being killed too
- Any group not supporting jihadi vision

## Deep Cover Operatives in United States (2025)

### The 1,000+ Number

**Source:** President Amrullah Saleh / Afghanistan Green Trend (AGT)

**Legend's Statement:**
> "There are over 1,000 Taliban and ISIS-K operatives in the United States"

**Critical Distinction:**
> "These 1,000 are not the individuals that were emboldened after the United States abandoned Afghanistan and withdrew. These are not the individuals in the Afghan-American community in the diaspora or those we brought in - 120,000 that were evacuated. They're not members of those communities who are now sympathetic towards the Taliban."

**Who They Are:**
> "The 1,000 or so that I mentioned these are deep cover operatives that report to Sirajuddin Haqqani and then the leadership of the Taliban and ISIS-K"

### Taliban Fighters Going Back and Forth U.S.-Afghanistan

**Legend's Intel:**
> "There are Afghan Americans from California, from Tennessee, from Florida, from New Jersey, from New York that have went back and joined the Taliban that are serving with the Taliban right now and these folks go back and forth"

**Training Video Context:**
Discussion of Taliban training video showing advanced tactics

**Legend:**
> "They were trained - most of them were trained by the US Special Operations community while we were there. Some were evacuated to the United States by the Biden Administration and then they decided to go back. They decided to go back and join the Taliban."

**The Process:**
- Trained by U.S. Special Operations
- Evacuated to United States
- Went back to Afghanistan
- Joined Taliban
- Get debriefed and rebriefed by Taliban/Haqqani
- Sent back to United States
- "Don't think that individual you see in the range is only in Afghanistan - they're going back and forth"

### Multiple Terrorist Organizations Represented

**Sarah Adams:**
> "When he says there's a thousand just under the bucket of ISIS-K and the Haqqanis right, then we talk about all the groups Al-Qaeda is aligned with how many of those are in the country because Al-Qaeda is saying that's another thousand right"

**The Groups:**
1. Taliban operatives
2. ISIS-K operatives
3. Al-Qaeda operatives
4. Haqqani Network operatives
5. All aligned groups

**The Scale:**
> "These numbers start to get really big when you bring all these groups under one umbrella to fight a common enemy: us"

### Why They're Here

**Purpose:**
> "They want you to feel it in your neighborhood, at your home. They don't want you to feel safe where you live now"

**Motivation:**
> "We impacted them in Afghanistan, we impacted them in Iraq, we impacted them in Syria which is kind of the most recent open wound right, and so they want our warfighters who did that in those countries to feel it here"

## U.S. Embassy Plots (2025)

### Active Threats Identified

**Two Current Embassy Plots:**
1. U.S. Embassy in Bamako, Mali
2. U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia

**Taking physical U.S. dollars cash from Afghanistan, bringing to Africa**

### Somalia Context

**Biggest Concern Right Now:**
- Next push of caliphate plan
- Push U.S. government out of Somalia
- Somalia fall to Al-Shabaab or ISIS
- Really part of Al-Qaeda's caliphate plan (just like Syria)

**Sarah Adams:**
> "We are actually funding with these dollars we send to fight ISIS, plots against us in Africa of all places besides here in the homeland. It's insane that we're funding these incidents that are going to kill Americans."

**The Coming Blame:**
> "Think of how that's going to come back right. We have some Americans die let's say Mogadishu, we have a bombing go off in Virginia, and then when you track the money down the money came from the US government. But think of how Americans are going to handle this and that's what the terrorists want. They want you to blame your government."

## Community Preparedness Case Studies from Episode 184

### The Gathering Storm Project

**Genesis of the Book:**
Scott Mann and Sarah Adams analyzed unclassified case studies to help communities prepare

**Case Studies Analyzed:**
1. DC Sniper
2. Beslan School Siege (Chechens, over 1,000 children in gymnasium, explosives on basketball goals)
3. 2008 Mumbai
4. October 7, 2023
5. New Orleans Bourbon Street
6. Others

**Methodology:**
"A lot like how US Army Special Ops Command and others do case studies - they'll take they'll migrate those practical lessons learned into operators modern times. That's what we did."

### Key Finding

**Different in Every Location:**
> "It's different in every county, it's different in every municipality because context is everything but if these attacks are going to be locally manifested then that's where the conversations need to start because that's going to be the real resilience."

**Questions Over Answers:**
> "Where we didn't have the answers we just put the questions in there - here's what communities should be asking themselves. Hopefully more books will be written that are technically specific on those questions and we just keep it going."

### Case Study: Pulse Nightclub

**Original Target:** Disney Springs (downtown Disney area)

**Surveillance:**
- Shooter and wife did surveillance
- Chose it as target
- Had gun in stroller

**What Happened:**
- Too much Disney security that day when he arrived
- Got back in car
- Drove around
- Thought of another venue
- Picked Pulse Nightclub later

**Result:**
> "Horrible thing happened but Disney having their security and upping their posture from the time he surveilled and said I'm going to do it to going back and having more security he said okay this isn't worth it for me"

**The Lesson:**
> "We all harden right, we make all these targets more difficult, we keep thwarting them in that way. When people have to change the venue of their target it might not be the same day like he did, they might have to do a week later. That gives law enforcement one more week to maybe identify him and thwart him right. We want to thwart this plot. We want to stop it from happening. Buying time and making the terrorists have to hide out longer, spend more money, that helps us get them faster."

### Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Festival

**The Scenario:**
- Tens of thousands of people
- Single shooter from Mandalay Hotel
- More than 10 weapons with bump stocks
- Took police over an hour to get into his room
- He was already dead

**The Paralysis:**
> "An hour single shooter...if you just look at the level of paralysis that happens from that, you add to that 7, 8, 10 well-trained operatives like you saw in that video right who then hit multiple nodes at one time and who have a pre-existing mandate to hold terrain with explosives and children out of school"

**70% Survival Due to First Aid:**
> "They say 70% of the people who survived survived because the people in their vicinity had first aid training. A lot of it was former military members but those citizens stepped up and did the initial triage and the initial aid and it saved 70% of those people."

### DC Sniper Comparative Impact

**9/11 vs. DC Sniper:**
> "9/11 attack happened - explosion, F-16s flying supersonic just above the treetops and right over here the McDonald's was still open, people still getting food."

**Versus:**
> "DC sniper - two dudes in the back of a car for 3 weeks - the entire city was paralyzed in lockdown, people on a knee getting gas, kids not going outside to play"

**The Difference:**
> "That's the difference. There's the spectacular thing that's over there but then there's where you live and you work and you play and they have figured that out."

## Past Attacks - Detailed Timelines

### 2008 Mumbai Attacks

**Date:** November 26-29, 2008
**Location:** Mumbai, India
**Perpetrators:** Lashkar-e-Taiba (Pakistani-based terrorist group)
**Casualties:** 166 killed, over 300 injured
**Significance:** Template for future attacks including October 7th and planned U.S. homeland attacks

#### Attack Methodology

**Swarming Attacks:**
- Multiple locations targeted simultaneously
- Coordinated strikes on hotels, railway station, and other targets
- Overwhelmed response capabilities through simultaneous operations

**Operational Flexibility:**
- Attackers given latitude to change locations and tactics in real-time
- Example: Train station was supposed to be bombing operation
- Terrorists saw more people, switched to shooting attack
- Real-time decision making based on target environment

**Real-Time Intelligence:**
- Command center feeding information to attackers throughout operation
- Monitoring news coverage
- Tracking police responses
- Attackers adjusted tactics based on intelligence feed
- Extended attack duration over multiple days

**Extended Duration:**
- Not hit-and-run operation
- Sustained engagement over 60+ hours
- Attackers fought until death or killed
- Maximum casualties achieved through prolonged engagement
- Maximum media coverage and terror impact

#### Why This Model is Preferred

**Al-Qaeda Assessment:** Mumbai model provides:
1. Maximum chaos through simultaneous attacks
2. Flexibility to exploit opportunities
3. Extended duration creates sustained terror
4. Media amplification through ongoing coverage
5. Overwhelms security response capabilities

**Application to Future Attacks:**
- October 7th attacks based on Mumbai model
- U.S. homeland attacks will use same methodology
- European attacks planned using same template
- Proven effective against prepared security forces

### 2012 Benghazi Attacks

**Date:** September 11-12, 2012
**Locations:** U.S. Diplomatic Compound and CIA Annex, Benghazi, Libya
**Casualties:** 4 Americans killed (Ambassador Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, Glen Doherty)
**Attack Force:** 150 terrorists (50+ confirmed Al-Qaeda members)
**Objective:** Kidnapping operation targeting Ambassador Stevens for prisoner exchange

#### Supreme Command Structure

**Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri (Al-Qaeda Head):**
- Directly orchestrated the operation
- Personal motivation: Two deputies killed in U.S. drone strikes Pakistan (June 2011)
- After second strike: "Enough's enough, we're going to take it to the Americans in Libya"
- Handed execution to AQIM (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb)

**Operational Command Chain:**
1. **Droukdel** (AQIM leader) - Received orders from Zawahiri
2. **Mokhtar Belmokhtar (MBM)** - Kidnapping operations expert, designated Mastermind
3. **Omar al-Shalali** - Ground attack commander, AQIM head for Libya 2012

**Additional Support:**
- **AQAP (Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula):** Funded operation, issued fatwa
- **Egypt-based operatives:** Al-Zawahiri reached out to multiple operatives for support

#### Attack Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Kidnapping Ambassador Stevens

**Target Prisoners for Exchange:**
1. **Adel al-Shalali** - Libyan on death row in Iraq, close friend of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
2. **The Blind Sheikh** (Omar Abdel-Rahman)
3. **Abu Faraj al-Libi** - Held at Guantanamo
4. **Aafia Siddiqui** - Believed to be in Texas

**Context:**
- Three weeks before Benghazi: Al-Qaeda kidnapped Quds Force officer in Benghazi, demanded five Al-Qaeda in Iraq detainees
- Set precedent for kidnapping-for-prisoner-exchange strategy

#### Attack Force Composition

**Total Force:** 150 terrorists dedicated to kidnapping operation

**Force Distribution:**
- 75 terrorists: Assaulted compound directly
- 75 terrorists: Cordoned off surrounding streets

**Fighter Quality:**
- Minimum 50 confirmed Al-Qaeda members
- Remaining fighters: Al-Qaeda affiliates
- Combat experience spanning:
  - Afghanistan Mujahideen era (Soviet-Afghan War)
  - Algerian Civil War (200,000 civilians killed)
  - Iraq Wars (2003-2004 onward)
  - Libyan Revolution
  - Post-Benghazi: Syria

**Leadership Relationships:**
- Nearly every senior leader had established relationship with Zawahiri, Bin Laden, or Zarqawi
- Only exception: English-speaking businessman recruited during MBM's village takeover in Algeria
- Role: Communicate with Ambassador during captivity
- Two Canadians also recruited as English speakers to manage Ambassador in shifts

#### Timeline - September 11, 2012 (Diplomatic Compound)

**9:42 PM:** Attack begins on diplomatic compound

**9:48 PM:** CIA receives immediate call from compound
- GRS (Global Response Staff) team visible on cameras
- Sitting in cars, ready to depart
- Waiting for orders to respond

**9:48-10:05 PM:** The 17-Minute Delay
- Bob (Chief of Base) called Fawzi Bukatef (head of 17th February Brigade)
- Response: "I'm not sending you any help. I don't have any help to send you. I'm not sending you any help tonight."
- **17th February Brigade had sent ~25 terrorists to participate in attacks**
- Bob lied to GRS team: "We're waiting on 17th February to respond"
- **Bob knew from first call they weren't responding**

**~10:00 PM:** Fire started at guard shack inside consulate

**10:05 PM:** CIA team finally departs (23 minutes after attack began)
- Only left when State Department officer said: "If you don't come now we're going to die"
- Team said "screw it" and abandoned Bob's orders

**10:07 PM:** CIA team arrives at compound (2-3 minute trip)

**~10:10 PM:** Terrorists reach Ambassador's villa
- Cannot initially gain entry
- Begin setting fire to villa at this time

**Critical Analysis:**
- GRS was ready at 9:48 PM
- Fire on Ambassador's villa started around 10:10 PM
- If GRS had departed when ready: "Mathematically they would have been there before the fire started - they wouldn't even have to put out a fire"
- **The 17-minute delay was the difference between prevention and response**

**Result:** First two deaths
- Ambassador Chris Stevens (smoke inhalation)
- Sean Smith (State Department Information Management Officer, smoke inhalation)

#### Timeline - September 12, 2012 (CIA Annex - Separate Operation)

**Context:** CIA Annex attack was **NOT part of Al-Qaeda's plan**. Wasam bin Hamid took advantage of Al-Qaeda's attack to conduct his own operation.

**~1:00 AM:** Wasam bin Hamid hanging out outside watching consulate attack
- Received phone call from contact in Tripoli
- Caller: "Hey I just got a call from the Americans here, they're sending a rescue force from Tripoli to Benghazi and they want you to help"
- Wasam's reaction: "What the fuck? There's more Americans coming to Benghazi?"
- Overheard after call: **"I'm going to kill all the Americans tonight"**
- Formulated mortar attack plan

**1:30 AM:** Team Tripoli arrives at Benghazi airport
- Wasam had sent commander to interdict Team Tripoli
- Purpose: Hold them at airport to buy time for mortar setup

**1:30-5:00 AM:** Team Tripoli held at airport
- Held by commander working unknowingly for Wasam bin Hamid
- Commander received call from Wasam: "Let them go"
- CIA officer overheard conversation in real time

**5:05 AM:** Team Tripoli arrives at CIA Annex
- Commander who escorted them enters building
- Inside: Bob (Chief of Base), CIA personnel, GRS team lead
- Wasam called commander's fighters outside
- Ordered them to abandon building immediately
- Fighters protest: "I can't leave my commander inside"
- Wasam: "I don't care about your commander, leave"
- Forces abandoned the building

**5:17 AM:** First mortar hits CIA Annex (12 minutes after Team Tripoli arrival)

**Deaths from Mortar Attack:**
- Tyrone Woods (former Navy SEAL, GRS contractor)
- Glen Doherty (former Navy SEAL, GRS contractor)

#### Government Response Failures

**Bob (Chief of Base) Failures:**
1. Did not believe in QRF doctrine
2. Viewed 17th February Brigade as his QRF
3. Lied to GRS team about 17th February response
4. 17-minute delay caused first two deaths
5. **Received highest CIA award for Benghazi**
6. Last known position: Trainer at CIA training facility

**Military Response:**
- No resources deployed to Benghazi until 5:00 AM (after last attack at 5:17 AM)
- All resources directed to Tripoli based on unverified Facebook threat
- CIF in Croatia didn't have their airplane with them
- Both deployed teams flew to Italy, not Libya
- Fighter jets never considered
- General Housi (Libyan Air Force) gave blanket approval immediately: "Send in what you want, do what you want, you have free reign"

**Obama Actions:**
- Told Secretary of Defense: "Use all means to do this"
- **Got on plane to Las Vegas to see Beyoncé and Jay-Z during ongoing attack**
- Did not stay to ensure orders followed

**Hillary Clinton:**
- Changed FAST team four times (uniforms, aircraft type)
- All negotiations unnecessary - Libya had given blanket approval
- Knew in real time it was Al-Qaeda (email to daughter)
- Pushed false video narrative publicly

#### The False Narrative

**Jake Sullivan:** Created video narrative (currently National Security Advisor)

**The Video:**
- "Innocence of Muslims" anti-Islamic video
- Originally released Spring 2011
- Translated version August 2012
- Egypt protest organizers were Benghazi planners (Al-Zawahiri's brother, Mokhtar Salem)
- Video went viral September 13 (two days AFTER attack)
- Only went viral because policy makers pushed it

**Intelligence Failures:**
- NSA report cut/pasted comment from press
- Stated: "At 5:00 PM there were protests in Benghazi"
- Actually: Nothing at 5:00 PM in Benghazi; 5:00 PM Cairo time
- Wrong time AND wrong location
- Marked Top Secret SCI despite being from press reports
- False information elevated as premium intelligence

#### Current Status of Attackers

**In U.S. Custody (Scapegoats):**

1. **Ahmed Abu Khattala** - Colorado prison
   - Not an attacker, not mastermind
   - Al-Qaeda never shared attack plans with him
   - Stayed outside entire attack
   - Went into compound only after GRS left
   - Jury didn't give death penalty - saw through narrative

2. **Mustafa al-Imam** - 19 years prison
   - No Al-Qaeda background
   - "Terrorist for a few weeks"
   - Within half mile of capture: three senior attackers (ignored)

**Released (July 2023):**

**Ziyad Belam:**
- Top 3-4 senior Al-Qaeda members at attacks
- Captured Istanbul airport July 2023
- US-aligned Libyan government intervened
- Released after 10 days
- **Stole CIA SAW (machine gun) night of attacks**

**In Afghanistan:**

1. **Hamza al-Darwi:**
   - Ran electronics workshop for Bin Laden
   - Bin Laden's guy for innovative attack methods
   - Top target when Adams in Pakistan
   - Top target when Adams arrived Benghazi August 2012
   - Sanctioned by U.S.
   - **Currently training terrorists to attack United States**
   - Information provided to U.S. government - no action taken

2. **Ibrahim al-Banna (AQAP commander):**
   - U.S. thought he was dead
   - Currently in Afghanistan
   - **Hangs out with Hamza bin Laden**

3. **15 High-Value Targets Total:**
   - All have $1 million+ bounties
   - All Al-Qaeda or similar groups (not Taliban)
   - All in Afghanistan
   - All ignored by U.S. government

### 2021 Abbey Gate Bombing

**Date:** August 26, 2021
**Location:** Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul, Afghanistan
**Casualties:** 13 U.S. service members killed, approximately 170 Afghans killed
**Official Narrative:** Lone wolf ISIS-K suicide bomber
**Reality:** Coordinated attack planned by ISIS-K and Haqqani Network senior leadership

#### Background - The Haqqani Plant in ISIS-K

**Sanullah Ghafari Sarajai (aka Sa'ad, Sultan Aziz Azam):**
- 2018-2019: Ran 1,000-member Haqqani Network cell in Kabul
- Very close to Sirajuddin Haqqani (Haqqani Network leader, Taliban Interior Minister)

**The Deal:**
- Context: Doha Agreement in place
- Sirajuddin to Sanullah: "When Doha deal is in place, as Haqqani Network I can no longer do suicide attacks and bombings per the agreement. I need a way to still commit attacks. Will you join ISIS?"
- Sanullah agreed - became plant in ISIS
- Quickly became ISIS-KP head for Kabul due to his network

**March 2020:** ISIS-KP Shura meeting in Kandahar raided
- 38 people arrested (all senior ISIS-KP leadership)
- Previous leader Osama Farooqi captured
- After leadership captured, ISIS-KP deferred to Sanullah (had most fighters)
- **Sanullah became leader of ISIS-KP**
- **Critical fact: ISIS-KP leader is a Haqqani Network plant**

#### Timeline - Planning to Execution

**August 13, 2021:**
- U.S. announces Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO)
- Taliban and ISIS-K leadership learn evacuation timeline

**August 15, 2021:**
- Abdul Rahim Sangari released from Bagram prison
- 2 days after NEO announcement
- True name: Abdul Rahim Sangari (not Abdul Rahman al-Logari as CENTCOM reported)

**August 18, 2021:**
- Sangari in Kandahar operational planning meeting
- **3 days after his release**
- Senior ISIS-K and Haqqani leadership present
- Attack planned in this meeting
- **Planning location: Same location used for October 7th planning**

**August 21, 2021:**
- Haqqani Network chooses three senior commanders
- Role: Man the gates and allow bomber through

**August 23, 2021:**
- Taliban shift security forces from North Gate to Abbey Gate
- Deliberately concentrating forces where bombing planned
- Goal: Maximize casualties

**August 25, 2021:**
- U.S. issues threat warning about suicide bomber
- Warning came too late to change operations

**August 26, 2021:**
- Attack executed at Abbey Gate
- Over 170 Afghans killed
- 13 U.S. service members killed

**Timeline Summary:**
- NEO announcement to bomber in planning meeting: 5 days
- Bomber's release to attack execution: 11 days
- Demonstrates speed and sophistication of planning

#### Command and Control

**ISIS Khorasan Province:**
- Leader at time: Shahab al-Muhajir (later captured)
- Current leader: Sultan Aziz Azam (Sanullah - the Haqqani plant)
- **Demonstrates Haqqani control of ISIS-K**

**Haqqani Network:**
- Sirajuddin Haqqani: Overall leader, approved operation
- Three senior commanders at gates (names known but not fully disclosed)
- **Hafiz Zahir Hamidi:** Terrorist who told bomber "you're in a good spot now, blow"

**Security Manipulation:**
- Taliban (Haqqani Network) controlled all external security at Abbey Gate
- Deliberately concentrated forces at Abbey Gate
- Diverted security from North Gate
- Created target-rich environment
- Allowed bomber through their lines

#### CENTCOM Investigation Failure

**Duration:** 3.5 years (released April 2024)

**Key Failure:** Report stated bomber was "Abdul Rahman al-Logari - that's a Kunya or an alias"
- **After 3.5 years, never identified his true name**

**Sarah Adams' Investigation:**
- Started: April 2024 (when CENTCOM report released)
- Released: August 2024
- Duration: 4 months
- **Result: Found bomber's true name - Abdul Rahim Sangari**

**Other Cover-Ups:**
- Haqqani Network involvement concealed
- Presented as "lone wolf" ISIS bomber
- Was coordinated attack between ISIS-K and Haqqani Network
- **12 terrorists identified in total:**
  - 7 Haqqani Network members
  - 5 ISIS members

#### U.S. Government Knowledge Question

Sarah Adams and team identified:
- Planning meeting location (Kandahar)
- All participants
- Movement of bomber
- Movement of ISIS-K leader (Sanullah/Sa'ad) to Kabul
- Identity of three facilitators at gates
- Hafiz Zahir Hamidi who gave final detonation order

**Adams' Question:** "If I can go find out where the planning meeting took place... I know all that on my own collecting on my own - how can the US government not collect that?"

**Two Possibilities:**
1. U.S. government did collect it and is covering up
2. U.S. government didn't collect it (profound intelligence failure)

**Adams' Conclusion:** "If they aren't collecting it we got a lot more to worry about."

### 2023 October 7th Hamas Attacks

**Date:** October 7, 2023
**Location:** Southern Israel
**Casualties:** 1,200+ killed, 240+ taken hostage
**Attack Force:** 1,400-1,500 attackers
**Key Finding:** Al-Qaeda operation, not primarily Hamas. Hamas was executing force, but planning, training, and coordination done by Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Iranian IRGC, and internal Iranian military units.

#### Planning Timeline

**March 2022:** Planning began
- Context: After Russia invaded Ukraine
- Terrorists believed world focus on Ukraine created opportunity
- Reached out to Russia for approval
- Russia encouraged attack

**Original Target Date: October 7, 2022**

**Significance of Date:**
- October 7, 2001: Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- George Bush announced operation and began carpet bombing Kandahar
- **This connects October 7th directly to Afghanistan**
- Most Americans and government don't recognize this connection

**July 31, 2022:** U.S. drone strike killed Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul
- Al-Qaeda feared U.S. would bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Worried about losing base/safe haven
- Reached out to Russia requesting continued pressure for 2022 attack
- Russia wanted attack to relieve Ukraine war pressure
- **Al-Qaeda decided to delay to 2023**

**Revised Timeline:**
- Attack delayed exactly one year
- Gave attackers additional year of training (beneficial)
- October 7, 2023: Attack executed

**Training Dates:**
- **August 7, 2022:** Training began
- **Significance:** Anniversary of 1998 Tanzania and Kenya embassy bombings
- Originally planned: 2 months training (August-October 2022)
- **Actually received: Over 1 year training due to delay**

#### Planning Locations

**Primary Planning Meetings:**

1. **First Meeting: Kandahar, Afghanistan**
   - Key decision maker: Saif al-Adel (Al-Qaeda military commission head)
   - Chose the date: October 7th
   - Selected for Afghanistan connection

2. **Second Meeting: Kabul, Afghanistan**
   - Refinement of operational details

3. **Subsequent Planning:**
   - Primarily via Telegram
   - Demonstrates vulnerability in communications security
   - Should have been interceptable by intelligence services

**Training Location:**
- Afghanistan camps
- 1,500 fighters trained (originally planned 500 in 2 months)
- Additional time allowed more training and more fighters
- Trained at Al-Qaeda camps in Uruzgan and Kandahar provinces

#### Key Participants and Roles

**Al-Qaeda:**
- Overall operational planning
- Saif al-Adel: Military commission leader, date selection
- Training camp provision
- Command and control

**Taliban:**
- **Hibatullah Akhundzada (Supreme Leader):** Issued fatwa authorizing attack
- Provided training camps
- Logistical support
- Coordination with other groups

**Iran/IRGC:**
- **Mohammad Kazemi:** Key plotter, operations coordinator
  - Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
  - Previously protected Al-Qaeda leaders in Iran
  - Also masterminding Soleimani assassination revenge plot
  - **Not on FBI Most Wanted List** (major intelligence failure)
- **Qasem Soleimani:** Planned before death, infrastructure he built used
- **Various IRGC generals:** Go-ahead authority for attack
- **Internal Iranian military units**
- Various Iranian government elements

**Hamas:**
- Ground execution force
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Received training in Afghanistan
- Took operational direction from Al-Qaeda/Taliban/Iran coordination

#### Warning Signs Ignored

**Information Provided to Israel:**
- People observed Hamas terrorists training in Afghanistan
- Reports provided to Israeli government before attack
- Israel knew Hamas was planning "some big plot" in Afghanistan
- **No action taken**

**Adams' Warning:**
"I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake."

**Foreign Intelligence Confirmation:**
- European intelligence service contacted Adams
- Message: "Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."
- Confirms foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question: Does U.S. government have it and not preparing America?

#### Date Significance Research

**October 7th (2001):**
- Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- U.S. began carpet bombing Kandahar
- Direct Afghanistan connection most Americans don't recognize

**August 7th (1998):**
- Tanzania and Kenya embassy bombings
- Training for October 7th began on this anniversary

**September 11 (1922):**
Most Americans don't know why 9/11 was chosen:
- British Mandate began
- First time Westerner (British and Jewish) put in charge of Palestinian mandate
- Al-Qaeda cared about date from 1922
- Not about "school year starting" or "9-1-1" or "Allah"

**Implication:** Terrorists choose dates based on historical significance to them, not to us. Many potential dates from 20 years of Afghanistan/Iraq wars, Syria events, terrorist martyrs, historical grievances going back 100+ years.

#### Significance for U.S. Homeland Attacks

**October 7th as Template:**
- First in series of waves targeting Israel, Europe, and United States
- "Test run" for tactics to be used in U.S.
- Same planning structure
- Same coordination methods
- Same attack style being prepared for U.S.

**Training Correlation:**
- U.S. homeland attackers received similar training
- Advanced urban warfare
- Suicide bombing techniques
- Cover and covert operations
- Same camps, same instructors, same methods

**Tactics to Expect in U.S.:**
- Swarming attacks (multiple simultaneous targets)
- Combination of suicide bombers and fedayeen fighters
- Real-time intelligence and coordination
- Ability to change targets and tactics during operation
- Extended engagement (fighters will fight to death)
- Based on October 7th and 2008 Mumbai attacks

**The Afghanistan Connection:**
"Everybody who's like why do we care about Israel why is that our problem - that's just the first in the series that's coming for us. That's like the test run."

## Planned Future Attacks (2025)

### U.S. Homeland Attacks

**Status:** Training complete, deployment underway
**Attack Force:** 1,000+ trained terrorists (Al-Qaeda claims; Adams believes actual number higher)
**Attack Model:** October 7th/Mumbai swarming attacks with real-time intelligence
**Certainty Level:** Adams states "I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both"

#### Training Completed

**Three Primary Training Types:**

1. **Advanced Urban Warfare**
   - Extended training program
   - Tactics seen in Taliban training videos
   - High proficiency level
   - Multiple attackers through same training

2. **Suicide Bombing Training**
   - Separate specialized camps
   - Approximately 20% of all camps do this training
   - "Invisible bomb vest" technology
   - Defeats magnetometers and K-9 detection

3. **Cover and Covert Operations**
   - Don't mention Afghanistan
   - Don't mention Al-Qaeda
   - Use fake names even in training camps
   - Extensive operational security
   - Terrorists don't even know each other's real names

**Training Status:**
- All training completed
- Attackers deployed
- "Training information now old (already done)"
- "Won't see new training information - it's finished"

#### Entry into United States

**Southern Border Route (Primary for general terrorists):**
- Through Darien Gap
- Up through South/Central America
- Across U.S. southern border
- Fake documents (Afghan, Syrian, Turkish passports)
- Challenge: Border Patrol agents mostly haven't been overseas
- Can't identify fake documents or wrong nationalities

**Legal Immigration (Al-Qaeda Preference):**
- "Clean" terrorists from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan
- Apply for legitimate tourist/travel visas
- Goal: "Embarrass system again like 9/11 attackers"
- Can fly directly to U.S.
- Legal status means less scrutiny
- Can wait indefinitely without raising suspicion

**Timeline Examples:**
- Fastest seen: Afghan leaving Afghanistan to U.S. border in 3 weeks
- Legal visa route: Can fly day after visa approved

#### Attack Methodology: Mumbai Model

**Why This Model:**

1. **Swarming Attacks:**
   - Multiple targets simultaneously
   - Overwhelms response capabilities
   - Creates maximum chaos and fear

2. **Operational Flexibility:**
   - Attackers given latitude to change locations and tactics
   - Real-time decision making
   - Can switch from bombing to shooting based on target environment

3. **Real-Time Intelligence:**
   - Command center feeding information to attackers
   - What's on the news
   - What police are doing
   - Attackers adjust accordingly
   - Makes attack last longer

4. **Extended Duration:**
   - Not hit-and-run
   - Sustained engagement
   - Maximum casualties over time
   - Maximum media coverage

#### Fedayeen Fighters (Critical Concept)

**Definition:** Fighters who fight to the death

**Significance:**
- "We haven't had fedayeen attackers" in United States
- Americans don't understand this concept
- U.S. first responders not trained for this

**Combat Characteristics:**
- Fight for multiple days if necessary
- Will not surrender
- Apparent surrender may be deception
- May still have suicide vest
- Will detonate if guards lowered

**Training Level:**
"Remember their life is they train all the time. If that's all you're doing all day long I mean you're going to get really competent in it."

**Secondary Attacks:**
Example from Kabul:
1. First bomber detonates
2. First responders move in
3. Second bomber walks in and detonates
4. Americans don't understand this is standard tactic

**Tactical Problem:**
- Battle ongoing, attacker appears to surrender
- Might have suicide vest
- First responders let guard down
- "That man came to die"
- Will fight until death or detonation
- Second and third order casualties from not understanding intent

#### Suicide Bombers in U.S.

**Historical Context:**
- Never had significant suicide bombing in United States
- Only example: Nashville bomber (deliberately avoided casualties)

**Coming Attacks:**
- "We have not had a man walk up to a building with a suicide vest on in the United States"
- "Americans don't understand this"
- "Al-Qaeda knows this"

**Innovation - The "Invisible Bomb" Vest:**

**Developer:** Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula (Yemen)

**Capabilities:**
- Passes through standard airport magnetometers
- Components not detectable by trained explosive-sniffing dogs
- Can be worn concealed under clothing
- Allows terrorist to enter secure facilities undetected

**Technology:**
- Video demonstration released December 2023 (quickly removed)
- TSA ignored demonstration's implications
- Can walk inside buildings now (not just outside)

**Significance:**
- Most U.S. buildings unprepared
- Standard security measures (metal detectors, K-9 units) ineffective
- No apparent U.S. government preparation or countermeasures
- Increases vulnerability of all soft targets

#### Mixed Force Composition

**Not Just Al-Qaeda:**
- 1,000 total attackers
- Mix of Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters
- ISIS fighters deliberately included
- Purpose: ISIS will claim responsibility

**Attribution Strategy:**
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- U.S. intelligence will support ISIS attribution
- Taliban has been feeding U.S. intel on ISIS attackers for years
- After attack: U.S. will search databases
- Will find: "Yeah we had pieces on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers in system already identified as ISIS
- **"That's how well they've planned this"**

#### Target Selection

**Al-Qaeda Preferences:**

1. **Symbolic Targets:**
   - U.S. Capitol (specifically mentioned)
   - In Al-Qaeda propaganda since 9/11
   - National monuments
   - Government buildings

2. **Economic Targets:**
   - Bridges (specifically mentioned)
   - Public transportation (metro systems mentioned)
   - Infrastructure causing economic damage
   - Transportation hubs

3. **Mass Casualty Locations:**
   - Places that cause fear
   - Economic impact sites

**ISIS Preferences:**
- "Just wants mass casualty"
- Softer targets
- Wherever most people are
- Opportunity-driven

**Tactical Flexibility:**
Example scenario:
- ISIS terrorist assigned to DC Metro
- Goes down, sees only 20 people
- Sees event above ground with hundreds
- Changes target to event
- Authorized to make decision in real time

**Soft Targets:**
- Universities
- Churches
- Stadiums
- Farmers markets
- Schools
- Shopping centers
- Any high-density civilian location

#### Coordination and Timing

**"Coordinated" Attacks - Unclear Exact Meaning:**
- All same time?
- Multiple days in sequence?
- U.S. and Europe simultaneously?
- Different cities in U.S. at same time?

**Multiple Interpretation Scenarios:**

1. **U.S. Only:**
   - Multiple cities
   - Same time or sequential days
   - Sustained operation

2. **U.S. and Europe:**
   - Simultaneous attacks on both continents
   - Same day/time
   - Maximum global impact

3. **Sequential Waves:**
   - Day 1: City A
   - Day 2: City B
   - Day 3: City C
   - Sustained terror over week

**What's Known:**
- Attacks will be "coordinated"
- Exact definition unclear
- All involve multiple simultaneous locations at some level

#### Casualty Estimates

**Scott Mann reportedly told Shawn Ryan:** Al-Qaeda predicting 50,000-60,000 American deaths
(Adams did not confirm specific number but confirmed scale of planning)

#### Intelligence Pre-Planting

**The Setup:**
- Taliban feeding information to U.S. government for years
- Small pieces on individual ISIS-K terrorists
- Entering U.S. intelligence databases
- Creating paper trail

**After Attack:**
- U.S. will search databases
- Will find prior intelligence on attackers
- "Yeah we had a little piece on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers will have similar database entries
- All pointing to ISIS

**Result:**
- U.S. intelligence will confirm "It's an ISIS attack"
- Will not recognize Al-Qaeda
- Will not recognize Taliban involvement
- Will not recognize state actor involvement (Russia, Iran, China)
- Attribution completely wrong, supported by years of planted intelligence

**Adams:** "That's how well they've planned this."

---

## Training Infrastructure

### Camp Organization

**Total Camps:** 30 Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan

**Breakdown:**
- 7 camps: Suicide bomber training exclusively
- 23 camps: General training

**Organization Methods:**

1. **By Ethnicity:**
   - Some camps separate Arabs from non-Arabs
   - Libyans, Somalians, Syrians may train separately
   - Maintains operational security
   - Reduces ethnic tensions

2. **By Training Type:**
   - Suicide bombing: 20% of camps specialize
   - Advanced urban warfare: Dedicated camps
   - Cover and covert operations: Specialized training
   - Mixed general training: Other camps

3. **By Organization:**
   - Now: "Islamic Army" umbrella
   - Recruits emerge identified as Islamic Army
   - Creates attribution confusion

### Training Curriculum

**Standard Training:**
- Weapons training
- Driving training
- Physical endurance
- Urban warfare

**Advanced Urban Warfare:**
- Extended training program
- Taliban training videos show professional level
- High proficiency demonstrated
- Team coordination
- Weapon proficiency

**Note:** Al-Qaeda training considered even higher level than Taliban. Cannot get video from Al-Qaeda camps (phones banned).

**Suicide Bombing:**
- Specialized camps
- Invisible vest technology
- Target selection
- Detonation timing

**Cover and Covert Operations:**
- Use fake names in camps
- Never mention Afghanistan or Al-Qaeda
- Maintain civilian cover if from Saudi/Kuwait
- Build normal life while waiting
- Extensive operational security

### Training Timeline Factors

**Duration Depends On:**
1. Number of attackers
2. Camp capacity
3. Type of training required
4. Ethnic/national groupings
5. Concurrent operations

**Examples:**

**October 7th:**
- Originally planned: 500 fighters, 2 months (Aug-Oct 2022)
- Actually executed: 1,500 fighters, 14+ months
- Delay improved training quality

**Syria Deployment:**
- 10,000 fighters
- Took priority for period
- Advanced training required

- Syria: 10,000 fighters trained
- **Total: ~13,500 in recent operations**
- **Islamic Army total: ~120,000 trained overall**

**Recruitment Volume:**
"There is no lack of bodies. There's no lack of terrorist volunteering."

### Camp Visitor Programs - Multi-Generational Strategy

**Al-Qaeda's Learning:**
- Old problem: Only trained first generation
- When U.S. drone strikes eliminated leaders, replacements inadequate
- "Third and fourth string of external operations sucked"

**New Approach:**
- Encourage marriage

- Education for children in ideology
- Complete social safety net

**Terrorist Testimony:**
From documentary "Jihad Rehab":
- "Was life easier in Afghanistan?" - "Yes"
- Complete social safety net provided
- Everything taken care of
- Focus entirely on jihad and training

**Long-term Goal:**
"We're never going to have that failure again where the second generation can't step up."

### Recruitment Demographics

**Primary Sources:**
- Afghanistan
- Pakistan
- Syria
- Libya
- Somalia
- Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan)
- Arab countries (Saudi, Kuwait, Jordan)
- North Africa

**Why So Many Recruits:**

1. **Social Safety Net:** Complete life support
2. **Purpose and Belonging:** Religious framework, clear mission
3. **Training and Weapons:** Professional military training, skills development
4. **Ideology:** Religious duty, martyrdom, anti-Western sentiment

---

## State Actor Support

### Russia

**Ukraine War Connection:**
- October 7th planning began March 2022 (after Russia invaded Ukraine)
- Terrorists contacted Russia asking if timing okay
- Russia: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"
- Russia wanted attack to divert attention from Ukraine

**When Attack Delayed:**
- Zawahiri killed July 2022
- Al-Qaeda wanted to delay to 2023
- Reached back out to Russia
- Russia: "No, do it in 2022, don't wait, I need pressure off me for Ukraine"

**Current U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- Information suggests Russian pipeline helping bring supplies into U.S.
- Supplies for Al-Qaeda homeland attack
- Moving through Russian channels
- Into United States

**Russian Strategy:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- Use terrorists as proxies against U.S.
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS, not Russia
- No obvious Russian connection
- "Very smart of them"

**Visitor Access:**
- Regular visitors to Kandahar
- Meeting with Taliban and each other
- Coordination on operations
- Intelligence sharing

### Iran/IRGC

**Historical Al-Qaeda Relationship:**

**Post-9/11:**
- Senior Al-Qaeda leaders fled Afghanistan
- Two destinations: Pakistan and Iran
- Most did not stay in Afghanistan to fight

**Pakistan Path:**
- Pakistani government took U.S. money
- Began capturing terrorists
- Result: Terrorists decided Pakistan unsafe

**Iran Path:**
- Terrorists and families relocated to Iran
- Lived with wives and children
- Developed close relationships with Iranian government
- Safer haven than Pakistan

**Qasem Soleimani:**
- Head of Iranian Quds Force
- Personally oversaw Al-Qaeda protection
- Created infrastructure to harbor terrorists
- Killed by U.S. drone strike January 2020

**Mohammad Kazemi:**
- Close friend and colleague of Soleimani
- Tasked by Soleimani: Keep Al-Qaeda leaders safe
- Specifically protected Hamza bin Laden, Saif al-Adel, Benghazi plotters
- **Current Position:** Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
- Co-plotter of October 7th
- Mastermind of Soleimani revenge plot
- **Not on FBI Most Wanted List** (intelligence failure)

**Current Cooperation:**

**Intelligence Sharing:**
- 100% confirmed between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian government receives intelligence from terrorists
- Terrorists receive intelligence from Iran

**Intelligence Base in Afghanistan:**
- Located: Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Iranian government has intelligence base inside camp
- Co-mingled operations

**October 7th Coordination:**
- Mohammad Kazemi traveled to Afghanistan
- Co-planned with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Hamas
- Hibatullah Akhundzada issued fatwa for attack
- IRGC general gave final "go" order
- Demonstrates deep Sunni-Shia coordination

**Nuclear/Radiological Concerns:**
- Iran's nuclear program access
- Afghanistan uranium mines
- Chinese involvement in uranium mines
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium use
- Dirty bomb potential specifically mentioned

**Visitor Access:**
- Regular IRGC presence in Kandahar
- Meeting with Taliban, Al-Qaeda, others
- Operational planning for attacks
- Resource sharing

### China

**Uranium Mines:**
- Afghanistan has significant deposits (beyond lithium)
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"

**Presence in Mines:**
- Chinese personnel
- Al-Qaeda operatives
- IRGC representatives (helping Al-Qaeda)

**Purpose:**
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- Not nuclear weapons development ("not exactly")
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, Al-Qaeda

**Long-term Strategy:**
- Viewing terrorists as potential proxies
- If U.S.-China war occurs, likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Longer game than Russia
- Building relationships and capabilities now

**Visitor Access:**
- Regular presence in Kandahar
- Meeting with Taliban and others
- Resource extraction focus
- Strategic positioning

### North Korea

**Visitor Access:**
- Present in Kandahar
- Meetings with Taliban and others
- Specific activities less detailed
- Part of broader anti-U.S. coordination

### Combined Effect

**Power Dynamics:**
- "To them, they beat us"
- Al-Qaeda and Taliban seen as power players
- "People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country"
- Adversaries treating Taliban/Al-Qaeda with respect
- "What can you do for me, what can I do for you"

**Supply Chain:**
- Russian channels moving Al-Qaeda supplies into U.S.
- Chinese providing resources/access in Afghanistan
- Iranian intelligence and planning support
- Multiple state actors facilitating

**Plausible Deniability:**
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- No mention of Al-Qaeda
- Definitely no mention of state actor involvement
- Perfect cover for all participants

**Capability Enhancement:**
- State-level resources + terrorist motivation
- Intelligence services + terrorist networks
- Technology + extremist ideology
- More sophisticated than traditional terrorist attacks

---

## Key Personnel and Networks

### Al-Qaeda Leadership

## Intelligence Failures and Warnings

### Federal Government Information Blackout

**Governor Ron DeSantis Statement:**
"I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from the federal government"

**Reality:**
- Zero federal threat information to state/local law enforcement
- State and local completely unprepared
- Cannot train for tactics they don't know about
- Same pattern as Israel before October 7th

**Florida Response (After Adams/Scott Mann Briefing):**
- Day after briefing: Briefed every sheriff in Florida
- Created information sharing mechanism
- Direct line between Adams' team and Governor's office

### Warning Signs Being Ignored

**Israel Pattern:**
- People passed information about Hamas training in Afghanistan
- Reports provided to Israeli government before attack
- Israel knew Hamas planning "some big plot" in Afghanistan
- No action taken
- October 7th happened

**Current U.S. Situation:**
- Same types of reports being passed to U.S. government
- About Al-Qaeda training for U.S. attacks
- U.S. not taking seriously
- Same pattern as Israel

**Adams' Warning:**
"I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake."

### Foreign Intelligence Confirmation

**European Intelligence Service:**
- Contacted Adams through intermediary
- Message: "Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."
- Confirms foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question: Does U.S. government have it and not preparing?

### Pentagon Interference (December 2024)

**Adams' Experience:**
- Identified threats against U.S. embassies in Africa
- Reached out directly to embassy staff (Ambassador, RSO)
- Pentagon sent "nasty gram" complaining about not using "formal channels"

**Pentagon's Focus:**
- Only concerned that Adams provided information directly
- No interest in collaboration or threat assessment
- No follow-up on intelligence itself
- Criticized information sharing despite it being unclassified

**Pentagon's Lack of Concern:**
- The actual threat
- Safety of embassy personnel (including DOD personnel)
- Source information
- Intelligence details

**Adams' Assessment:**
Pentagon prioritizes bureaucratic protocols over personnel safety and fails to recognize or act on legitimate threat intelligence from open-source channels.

### Information Adams Has Shared - Ignored

**A Year Ago:**
- Provided "something really good"
- "Actually did go up to the White House level"
- **"They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"**

**Pattern:**
Adams regularly provides intelligence on terrorist locations:
- **"I really just get 'thanks for your info.' Nothing happens."**

**Why No Action:**
- **"Because they want you to believe al-Qaeda does not exist in Afghanistan"**
- **"So how can you kill an al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan?"**
- **"They want us to forget about Afghanistan and move on"**

**Where She's Hearing This:**
- **"I've heard this from congressmen"**
- **"They really think this is just going to go away"**
- Assessment probability: **"100%"**

### Congressional Inaction

**Petition Results:**
- 382,000+ signatures to stop Taliban funding
- Submitted to Congress
- **Result: Zero action taken**

**Legislative Efforts:**

1. **House Bill - Congressman Burchett:**
   - Stop Taliban funding
   - Status: Sitting in Senate with no sponsor

2. **Taliban Designation Bill - Congresswoman Nancy Mace:**
   - Designate Taliban as terrorist organization
   - Status: Dead
   - Opposition: Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose
   - Result: Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists

**Congressman Michael McCaul (Chairman, House Foreign Affairs):**
- Recent incident: Public intoxication at airport
- Insider trading allegations
- Action on Taliban funding: None
- Pattern: Five-minute sound clips, no follow-through

### Collection Gap

**Adams' Question:** "I have no idea if we're even collecting traffic anymore"

**The Gitmo Example:**
- Found newest Benghazi attacker month or two ago
- In Gitmo "talking to Kenyans"
- Libyan source: "I hope your country is collecting what he's saying"
- Adams' thought: "My country doesn't even know this Gitmo guy was involved in Benghazi let alone he's still a terrorist"

**The Failure:**
- "We haven't even collected on what happened to Gitmo guys released"
- "Can you imagine what we're doing to anybody else?"
- **"We're not collecting on these guys"**

### U.S. Funding of Terrorists

**Weekly Cash to Kabul:** $44-87 million per week

**Eight Delivery Stops (All Designated Terrorists):**
1. Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund
2. Deputy PM Mullah Baradar
3. GDI (Abdul Haq Wasiq) - holds three Americans
4. Ministry of Interior (Sirajuddin Haqqani)
5. Sirajuddin Haqqani's house (direct delivery)
6. Hibatullah Akhundzada (Supreme Leader)
7. Al-Qaeda Military Commission (Saif al-Adel)
8. The Bin Laden Brothers (Hamza, Saad, Abdullah)

**Additional Funding:**
- Taliban Political Office Qatar: $10M/month (since 2013)
- Supreme Leader's Office: $3M/month (U.S. covers nearly entire budget)
- Refugee Program (Khalil Haqqani): $5M/month to Al-Qaeda camps

**Al-Qaeda's Irony:**
- Makes jokes about U.S. funding camps training homeland attackers
- Insider joke: "America is funding its own attack"
- Will use as propaganda: portray as "inside job"
- Goal: Make Americans distrust government

## Conclusion

The intelligence compiled in this report demonstrates:

1. **Sophisticated Planning:** Multi-year planning cycles, extensive training, state-level support
2. **Proven Methodologies:** October 7th and Mumbai models proven effective, will be replicated
3. **Training Complete:** All U.S. homeland attackers trained and deployed
4. **State Support:** Russia, Iran, China actively supporting operations
5. **Federal Failure:** Zero threat information to state/local law enforcement
6. **Same Pattern:** Identical intelligence failures that preceded October 7th
7. **Timeline:** 2025 attacks likely (though delays possible)
8. **Scale:** Potentially 50,000-60,000 casualties predicted by Al-Qaeda
9. **Attribution Deception:** Pre-planted intelligence will blame ISIS, conceal Al-Qaeda/state involvement
10. **Unprecedented Threat:** Al-Qaeda now larger and more capable than pre-9/11

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
"I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both."

**Critical Warning:**
"I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake."

**Report Date:** December 2025
**Source Material:** Sarah Adams interviews (Shawn Ryan Show Episodes 81, 81-2, 116, 149)
**Classification:** Open Source Intelligence Compilation

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents extensive international state actor support, coordination, and funding relationships that enable global terrorist networks. Analysis of four comprehensive interviews with former CIA targeter Sarah Adams reveals unprecedented levels of cooperation between terrorist organizations (Al-Qaeda, Taliban, ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah) and state actors (Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, Pakistan, Turkey, Qatar). Key findings include:

- **State-sponsored safe havens:** Iran harbored senior Al-Qaeda leadership throughout the 20-year Afghanistan War
- **Direct state funding:** U.S. provides $44-87 million weekly to Taliban, funding Al-Qaeda training camps
- **International coordination hub:** Kandahar serves as meeting location for Russians, Chinese, Iranians, North Koreans, and terrorist leadership
- **Multi-state attack support:** October 7th Hamas attacks and planned U.S. homeland attacks involve Iran, Russia, China coordination
- **Resource exploitation:** Chinese uranium mine operations in Afghanistan co-located with Al-Qaeda and IRGC developing dirty bomb capabilities
- **Intelligence sharing:** Confirmed 100% intelligence sharing between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran

## State Actor Support Overview

### The New Paradigm: Near-Peer Competition Through Terrorists

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
> "We're in near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists. Everybody's playing this game with the terrorists now."

Multiple state actors now provide coordinated support to terrorist networks:

**Primary State Sponsors:**
- **Iran:** Most deeply embedded, long-term relationships, operational coordination
- **Russia:** Tactical support for Ukraine war advantage, supply chains for U.S. attacks
- **China:** Long-term strategic positioning, resource extraction, proxy development
- **North Korea:** Regular coordination meetings, specific activities less disclosed
- **Pakistan:** ISI safe havens, Fat War plan coordination
- **Turkey:** Transit routes, medical treatment, terrorist presence
- **Qatar:** Political office funding since 2013

**Combined Effect:**
- Multiple state actors supporting same terrorist networks
- Each pursuing own strategic objectives
- Creates exponentially more capable and resilient terrorist capability
- Terrorists playing different states against each other
- Unprecedented level of international coordination

---

## Iran - Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)

### Historical Safe Haven (2001-Present)

**Post-9/11 Flight:**
- When U.S. invaded Afghanistan (2001), senior Al-Qaeda leaders fled to Pakistan and Iran
- Iran provided safer haven than Pakistan
- Terrorists and families lived in Iran throughout 20-year U.S. war
- Developed close relationships with Iranian government

**Key Protected Individuals:**
- Hamza bin Laden (harbored until January 2020)
- Saif al-Adel (Al-Qaeda military commission head)
- Benghazi plotters
- Various senior Al-Qaeda leadership

### Qasem Soleimani's Role

**Background:**
- Head of Iranian Quds Force (IRGC special operations)
- Personally oversaw Al-Qaeda protection infrastructure
- Created relationships that continue post-death
- Killed by U.S. drone strike January 2020 (ordered by President Trump)

**Significance to Iran:**
> "Qasem Soleimani isn't just a man in Iran - he was the symbol of the Iranian Revolution. He's like our Capitol or our Statue of Liberty - he's bigger than a man."

### Mohammad Kazemi - Current IRGC Coordinator

**Position:**
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
- One of most senior intelligence officials in Iran
- Close friend and colleague of Soleimani

**Responsibilities:**
- Tasked by Soleimani to keep Al-Qaeda leaders safe
- Protected Hamza bin Laden, Saif al-Adel, Benghazi plotters in Iran
- **Co-planner of October 7th Hamas attacks**
- **Mastermind of Soleimani assassination revenge plot**
- Regular travel to Afghanistan for coordination
- **Not on FBI Most Wanted List** (major intelligence failure)

**October 7th Planning Role:**
- Traveled to Afghanistan for planning meetings
- Met with Al-Qaeda leadership (Saif al-Adel)
- Met with Taliban leadership (Hibatullah Akhundzada)
- Met with Hamas representatives
- IRGC generals gave final "go" authorization
- Coordinated Iranian internal military units' participation

### Current Intelligence Sharing and Coordination

**Confirmed Intelligence Sharing:**
- 100% confirmed intelligence sharing between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian government receives intelligence from terrorist groups
- Terrorists receive intelligence from Iran

**Intelligence Base in Afghanistan:**
- Located inside Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Iranian government has intelligence base inside the camp
- Co-mingled operations with Al-Qaeda
- Direct coordination between state intelligence and terrorists

**Operational Coordination:**
- Joint planning of October 7th attacks
- Coordination for U.S. homeland attacks
- Embassy attack planning
- Islamic Army operations support

### Iranian Support for Specific Operations

**October 7th Hamas Attacks:**
- Mohammad Kazemi co-planned in Afghanistan
- IRGC generals gave go-ahead
- Iranian internal military units involved
- Logistics support
- Intelligence support
- Qasem Soleimani's infrastructure utilized

**U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- Intelligence and planning support through Kazemi
- IRGC resources committed
- Operational coordination with Al-Qaeda
- Timing possibly coordinated with Soleimani revenge plot

**Soleimani Revenge Plot:**
- **Budget:** $145 million per month
- Officially: Assassination plot against President Trump
- **Adams' Assessment:** Budget suggests much larger operation
- May include U.S. Capitol or other symbolic targets
- May be coordinated with broader Al-Qaeda homeland attack
- Equivalent response doctrine: Must match symbolic value of Soleimani

### Iranian Doctrine: Equivalent Response

**Pattern:**
- "If you hit their embassy, they hit your embassy"
- "If you kill their scientist, they do assassination"
- Soleimani was symbol of revolution
- Equivalent response must match symbolic importance
- One assassination insufficient
- Likely targeting national symbols or multiple high-value targets

### Uranium and Dirty Bomb Development

**Chinese Uranium Mines:**
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"
- **Al-Qaeda operatives present at mines**
- **IRGC representatives present**
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, and Al-Qaeda together

**IRGC Support Role:**
- Helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- "Not exactly" nuclear weapons development
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- Technical expertise sharing
- Resource access facilitation

**Strategic Concern:**
> "Think of that as they innovate on that and grow"

### Iran-Al-Qaeda Analyst Denialism

**Common Intelligence Assessment:**
- "Iran doesn't get along with Al-Qaeda"
- "Iran is attacking Al-Qaeda"

**Reality:**
- Iran harbored Al-Qaeda through entire Afghanistan War (2001-2021)
- Senior Al-Qaeda leadership lived safely in Iran for years
- Current ongoing operational coordination
- Joint planning of major attacks
- Intelligence sharing and bases

**Adams' Response:**
> "What are you talking about? They harbored them almost the entire war we had."

**Why Analysts Wrong:**
- Outdated sectarian assumptions (Sunni vs. Shia)
- Failure to recognize ideological flexibility
- Not tracking actual relationships
- Ignoring evidence
- Relying on old frameworks

### Strategic Implications

**Unified Front:**
- Sunni and Shia terrorist groups cooperating
- State actors (Iran) and non-state actors (Al-Qaeda) aligned
- Breaks traditional Middle East conflict patterns
- Creates more dangerous threat environment

**Safe Haven History:**
- Al-Qaeda had safe haven in Iran during U.S. war
- Now has safe haven in Afghanistan
- Iran provides additional security and support
- Allows long-term planning impossible without state protection

**Resource Sharing:**
- Iranian intelligence capabilities
- Al-Qaeda terrorist networks
- Taliban territory and training camps
- Combined: formidable capability

## Russia - Ukraine War Connection

### October 7th Approval and Encouragement

**Timeline:**

**March 2022:**
- Russia invades Ukraine (February 2022)
- Terrorists begin planning October 7th Hamas attacks (March 2022)
- Terrorists contact Russia: "Is timing okay for attack?"
- **Russia's response: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"**
- Russia wanted distraction/pressure relief from Ukraine war

**July 2022:**
- U.S. drone strike kills Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul
- Al-Qaeda fears U.S. will bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Wants to delay October 7th attack to 2023
- Contacts Russia about delay

**Russia's Response:**
> "No, do it in 2022, don't wait. I need pressure off me for my war in Ukraine."

**Result:**
- Al-Qaeda delayed anyway (their decision)
- Shows Russia actively encouraging terrorist attacks
- Russia viewing terrorists as useful proxies
- Willing to sacrifice others' security for Ukraine advantage

### U.S. Homeland Attack Support

**Supply Chain Support:**

**Adams' Statement:**
> "There is information that Russia and Russian pipelines are helping bring in some of the resources that are going to support Al-Qaeda's Homeland attack."

**Clarification:**
> "Their pipeline is helping move some of Al-Qaeda's supplies into the United States for the Homeland attack."

**Purpose:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- "Push at us for Ukraine just like we're doing stuff against Russia"
- Asymmetric response to U.S. aid to Ukraine
- Use terrorists as proxies against U.S.

**Type of Supply:**
- Adams knows specific supplies (stated "I'll tell you what the supply is")
- Did not fully disclose in interview for security reasons
- Moving through Russian channels into United States

**Strategic Logic:**
- Al-Qaeda will execute attack
- Will be blamed on ISIS
- "Definitely no one's going to say Russia played a piece in it"
- Perfect deniability for Russia
- "Very smart of them"

### ISIS-K and Russian Deception

**Moscow Attack:**
- ISIS Khorasan Province (Branch One - Sanaullah's branch) executed
- Russia aware of this ISIS-K threat
- Working with Taliban to counter ISIS-K

**The Taliban Ruse:**
- Real threat to Russia: Branch Two (Ghulam Kohistani in northern Afghanistan)
- Taliban hiding this from Russia
- Making Russia focus on Branch One only
- Sirajuddin Haqqani funding and protecting Branch Two
- Russia doesn't understand full picture

**Branch Two Details:**
- **Leader:** Ghulam Kohistani (former Tajikistan Special Forces)
- Based in northern Afghanistan
- Focus: Central Asian terrorist recruitment
- Threatens Russia directly
- "One of Russia's main global enemies"
- **Backed by Sirajuddin Haqqani**

**Russia's Vulnerability:**
- Has to work with Taliban to collect intelligence on ISIS
- "Just like we do"
- Taliban playing both sides
- Giving Russia information on one branch
- Hiding the branch actually threatening them
- Russia unaware Taliban funding actual threat to Russia

### Near-Peer Competition and Terrorist Proxies

**Current State:**
> "We're in near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists."

**Russia's Strategy:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine through terrorist proxies
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS, not Russia
- No obvious Russian connection
- Supply chain support provides plausible deniability
- Using Al-Qaeda's capabilities against U.S.

**Mutual Escalation:**
- U.S. likely funding some terrorists as proxies against Russia
- Russia funding terrorists against U.S.
- Both sides thinking they're winning
- Both vulnerable to blowback
- Terrorists benefiting from all sides

**Adams' Warning:**
> "To not think they're [Russia] trying to also undercut us and also get on the side of our enemy and hit us with our enemy... It's very smart of them."

### Taliban-Russia Coordination

**Russia's Position:**
- Working with Taliban for ISIS intelligence
- Believes Taliban helping counter ISIS threats
- Unaware Taliban protecting actual Russian threat (Kohistani)
- Unaware Taliban coordinating both ISIS-K branches

**Russia in Kandahar:**
- Regular visitors to Kandahar
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with other state actors present (Chinese, Iranians, North Koreans)
- Coordinate operations
- Share intelligence (selectively by Taliban)

---

## China - Belt and Road Strategy

### Historical Taliban Relationship (2009-Present)

**Mullah Baradar's Role (2009):**
- Taliban-China liaison since at least 2009
- Would travel to China for meetings
- Maintaining relationship with Chinese government
- Established bilateral cooperation

**Chinese Priorities:**
- **Primary ask:** Taliban collect intelligence on Uighurs
- "Pass it to us"
- Taliban reporting on other Muslims to China
- Contradiction to Taliban's claimed Islamic solidarity

**Taliban Requests:**
- "Help us get weapons or funds for weapons"
- Established bilateral cooperation framework

**Relationship Strength:**
> "Taliban-China relationship has been stronger than the US-Taliban relationship at least since 2009 for sure"

### Current Official Status (2023-2024)

**Ambassadorial Recognition:**
- **China is first and only country with official ambassador to Taliban government**
- "First and only country that has assigned an official ambassador to the Taliban government"
- Others have "weird envoys"
- Demonstrates China's commitment and long-term strategy

### Chinese Presence in Afghanistan

**Northern Alliance Reports:**
- Chinese officials "everywhere" in Afghanistan
- Building massive hotels right outside lithium deposits
- "Huge multi-million dollar structures"
- Unusual for Afghanistan: "In the middle of nowhere"

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Part of China's Belt and Road Initiative
- China already positioned through Baradar relationship
- Baradar "plays a huge part in the economics piece of current government"
- "Already positioned to hook China up with his closest ally"

### Lithium and Uranium Resources

**Lithium:**
- Afghanistan has very rich lithium deposits
- Lithium needed for batteries powering green energy
- Green energy comes from China
- U.S. "energy independence" actually means Chinese dependency

**Uranium (Less Publicized):**
- Afghanistan has significant uranium deposits
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"
- Chinese personnel on site
- Active mining operations

### Uranium Mines - Terrorist Coordination Hub

**Co-location:**
- Chinese mining personnel
- **Al-Qaeda operatives present at uranium mines**
- **IRGC representatives present**
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, and Al-Qaeda together

**Purpose:**
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- "Not exactly" nuclear weapons development
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- Chinese aware and allowing it
- May be providing resources or expertise
- "Think of that as they innovate on that and grow"

### Kandahar International Hub

**Chinese Representatives:**
- Regular visitors to Kandahar
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with Russians, Iranians, North Koreans
- Building relationships and agreements
- Coordination with terrorist leadership

### Long-Term Proxy Strategy

**Current Assessment:**
- "A little more of a longer game" than Russia
- Not immediate threat like Russia/Iran
- Building relationships now
- Positioning for future conflicts

**Adams' Concern:**
> "China is meeting with the terrorists. The place I have an issue with China is I do think China is going to find a way to use the terrorists as proxies."

**Future Scenario:**
- If U.S.-China war occurs
- China will likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Infrastructure already being built
- Relationships being established
- Resources being positioned
- Think in 100-year timelines

### Current Role in U.S. Homeland Attack

**Not Primary Sponsor:**
- U.S. homeland attack appears primarily Al-Qaeda/Iran/Russia supported
- China more background role currently
- But building capability for future

**Supply Chain Concerns:**
- Russian channels moving supplies
- Chinese providing resources/access in Afghanistan
- Combined state actor support enhances terrorist capability

### Strategic Assessment

**What China Gets:**
- Uighur intelligence from Taliban
- Resource extraction rights (lithium, uranium)
- Belt and Road corridor through Afghanistan
- Proxy force development for future conflicts
- Regional influence and power projection
- Counter-U.S. positioning

**What Terrorists Get:**
- State-level resources and protection
- Access to uranium for dirty bombs
- Financial support
- International legitimacy
- Safe haven in Taliban Afghanistan

**Combined Effect:**
- State-level resources + terrorist motivation
- Intelligence services + terrorist networks
- Technology + extremist ideology
- More sophisticated than traditional terrorist attacks

---

## North Korea - Kandahar Presence

### Regular Meetings in Kandahar

**Confirmed Presence:**
- North Korean representatives regularly visit Kandahar
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with other state actors (Russians, Chinese, Iranians)
- Part of international coordination hub

### Specific Activities

**Information Limited:**
- Specific activities less detailed in source material
- Part of broader anti-U.S. coordination
- Meetings with terrorist leadership confirmed
- Part of multi-state support network

### Strategic Context

**Anti-U.S. Alliance:**
- Part of broader coalition against U.S. interests
- Coordination with China, Russia, Iran, Taliban, Al-Qaeda
- Adds state-level capabilities to terrorist networks
- Demonstrates reach of anti-U.S. coordination

### Implications

**Power Dynamics:**
> "People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country by our enemies. They're treating them with respect. They're saying what can you do for me, what can I do for you."

**Combined State Actor Support:**
- Four hostile near-peer/peer states (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea)
- All coordinating in same location (Kandahar)
- All meeting with Taliban and Al-Qaeda
- All providing different capabilities
- Creates unprecedented terrorist capability

---

## Pakistan - ISI and Safe Havens

### Historical Context and Safe Havens

**Post-9/11:**
- Senior Al-Qaeda leaders fled to Pakistan and Iran
- Pakistani government took U.S. money
- Began capturing some terrorists (e.g., Khalid Sheikh Mohammed)
- But continued providing safe havens to others

**Throughout Afghanistan War:**
- Terrorists would fall back to Pakistan when pressured in Afghanistan
- U.S. captured and killed some there
- Pakistan remained safe haven throughout 20-year war
- "Even if funding resistance like Ukraine to go in, if terrorists fall back to Pakistan and can't be actioned, we get back to same situation"

### Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)

**Relationship Complexity:**
- CIA-ISI relationship broke down after Bin Laden raid (2011)
- Pakistan stopped issuing visas to CIA personnel
- Adams restarted cooperation with single phone call
- Working relationship but with fundamental tensions

**ISI Capabilities:**
- CT Directorate head negotiated Al-Mauritani capture
- Can conduct capture operations when motivated
- Intelligence sharing selective and strategic
- Playing multiple sides

### Current Taliban Support

**ISI Role:**
- Historical ties to Taliban (created Taliban)
- Continued support throughout war
- Current coordination on various operations
- Afghan government (pre-Taliban) had Taliban sympathizers
- Example: Requested Mullah Baradar's release, not rendition

### Fat War Plan

**Concept:**
- Taking territory in Pakistan-Afghanistan border region
- Involves Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and allied groups
- ISI elements supportive or complicit
- Threatens Pakistani state control

**Components:**
- TTP (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) conducting 800 attacks in Pakistan last year
- GDI "Immigrants Department" solely funds and supports TTP
- Taliban rotating units into TTP for Pakistan attacks
- Pakistani military kills attackers, identifies Afghan Taliban
- Dismissed as "you always blame Afghans"
- Part of Fat War plan - nobody realizes it's Afghan Taliban doing attacks

### ISIS-KP and Pakistan

**ISIS-KP Infrastructure:**
- Headquarters: Kunar Province, Afghanistan
- **All training camps: Located in Pakistan**
- Largest camp: Turbat, Pakistan (Baluchistan)
- Named Rozi (after hometown of founder Osama Farooqi)
- **Protected by Pakistan's Frontier Corps**

**Frontier Corps Problem:**
- Branch of Pakistani military (equivalent to National Guard moved to border)
- Provides security at embassies in Pakistan (streets around embassy enclave)
- Now infiltrated by ISIS-KP
- Harboring ISIS-KP
- Working with ISIS-KP
- **Huge insider threat concern** for protecting Americans and foreigners

### ISIS Leadership in Pakistan

**Beluchistan Base:**
- Panjgur area, Beluchistan, Pakistan
- Real ISIS (Iraq/Syria) relocated leadership here (2020)
- All ISIS committees based in Panjgur:
  - Shura committee
  - Operational committee
  - Leadership committee
  - Media committee

**Strategic Reasons for Panjgur:**
1. Access to sea through Beluchistan
2. Balochi people supportive of attacks on Iran
3. ISIS wanted to focus more on Iran
4. Balochi have Iranian, Pakistani, AND Afghan citizenship
   - Can move freely between three countries
   - Run all routes in area
   - Unlike others who would be restricted

**Sanullah Ghafari (ISIS Leader):**
- Member of Haqqani Network since 2012
- Was head of Haqqani Network in Kabul
- Now de facto head of ALL ISIS (including real ISIS in Panjgur)
- Demonstrates Haqqani/Taliban control of ISIS

### Pakistan-India-Taliban Triangle

**Indian Funding:**
- $10 million Indian payment to Mullah Yaqub
- Funded Bagram base
- Bagram: Where Hibatullah's (supreme Taliban leader) personal security based
- "Indian government or intel service funding Hibatullah's personal security - isn't that weird?"

**India Using Taliban Networks:**
- **India is using Taliban networks to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan**
- Killing Kashmir militants all over Pakistan (Lahore, Karachi, etc.)
- Also killing Sikh militants

**18 Targeted for Assassination:**
- Groups: Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen
- **Not one from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen** - this is key

**The Theory - Kashmir Future War Plan:**

**Hibatullah Connection:**
- Religious teaching from Fazal Rahman Khalil (founded Hizb-ul-Mujahideen)
- Still close friends
- Hibatullah gives U.S. money to HuM and their madrassas

**Adams' Theory:**
- Taliban and HuM decided to work together
- Use India to eliminate Kashmir militants aligned to Pakistan
- India doesn't understand this is what's happening or why invested
- Kashmir militants are Pakistani nationalists - can't be used in Fat War plan
- Taking out old guard of Kashmir militant leaders
- New generation more aligned to Taliban and Al-Qaeda than Pakistani military
- "Creating this whole new Kashmir landscape nobody has thought about"

### Weapons from Pakistan

**Haqqani Weapons Purchase in Libya:**
- Haqqani Network delegation to Libya to get weapons
- Pakistan complaints about TTP having M4s, M16s, U.S. gear
- Some marked "Property of US Government"
- Creates flak on Taliban
- Haqqani going to Libya may be to get different origin weapons

### Strategic Problem for U.S.

**Root Issue:**
> "Got into mess with Pakistan funding old Mujahedin against Soviets. Only way out and only way to deal with insane terrorist safe haven is we got to deal with Pakistan."

**Must Do:**
- Support anti-Taliban resistance
- Get resistance in Pakistan to work with Afghan resistance
- "Water under bridge, lot of bad history, but future is worse, we have to work together"
- Break Pakistan providing ISIS safe haven
- Address Frontier Corps infiltration
- Deal with TTP and Fat War plan

---

## Turkey - Transit and Terrorist Presence

### Transit Routes for Terrorists

**Primary Route to U.S.:**
- Afghanistan → **Iran** → **Turkey** → Brazil → Darien Gap → U.S.
- Turkey is key transit point for terrorists heading to U.S.
- Multiple terrorist groups confirmed using this route:
  - ISIS (8 members confirmed)
  - Haqqani Network (25-50 members)
  - Al-Qaeda (numbers not specified)

**Route Function:**
- Terrorists procure Afghan passports
- Travel through Iran
- Enter Turkey
- From Turkey obtain Brazilian visas
- Proceed to South America and northward

### Terrorist Presence in Turkey

**Key Figures:**
- Multiple Al-Qaeda operatives live in Turkey
- Benghazi terrorists travel to Turkey
- Muhammad al-Gharabi (Al-Qaeda Commander for Benghazi) travels between Libya and Turkey

**Medical Treatment:**
- Terrorists travel to Turkey for medical treatment
- Example: Terrorist who lost leg traveled to Turkey for treatment
- "Again it was in Turkey"
- "He'd been traveling back and forth to Turkey for treatment"

### Weapons Transit

**Libya-Syria Connection:**
- If moving weapons to Syria, would go through Turkey
- Turkey serves as transit point for weapons
- Not through Benghazi for Syria operations

**Historical Weapons:**
- **Russian SA-7s, SA-9s** from Libya went through Turkey
- Turkey serves as conduit for weapons to various theaters

### Khorasan Group and Turkey Operations

**Musa (Al-Qaeda Document Forger):**
- Al-Qaeda's travel facilitator
- Specialized in Turkey operations
- Focused on Turkish documents
- Turkish documents grant Europe access (easy to obtain through fraud)
- Made documents for external operatives leaving Afghanistan

**Al-Badri Brigade:**
- Libyan terrorists who joined ISIS in Syria
- Conducted Manchester Ariana Grande concert bombing
- Conducted multiple attacks in France including Bataclan theater
- **Musa provided travel documents for this group**
- Travel facilitated through Turkey

### Turkey as Strategic Node

**Why Turkey Matters:**
- Geographic position between Middle East and Europe
- Transit point for terrorists to Europe and Americas
- Medical services for terrorists
- Document fraud easier in Turkey
- Grants access to Schengen zone in Europe
- Part of NATO (complicates U.S. response)

**Turkish Government Role:**
- Extent of Turkish government knowledge/complicity unclear
- May be passive (inadequate border control)
- May be active (allowing transit)
- Creates challenges for U.S. policy (NATO ally)

---

## Qatar - Taliban Political Office

### Taliban Political Office Funding

**Duration:** Since 2013 to present (11+ years of continuous U.S. funding)

**Amount:** At least $10 million per month in operating expenses

**Source:** U.S. government funding

**Purpose (Official):**
- Venue for negotiations with Taliban
- Political representation for Taliban
- Site of Doha Agreement negotiations

**Purpose (Actual):**
- Legitimizes Taliban as political entity
- Provides consistent funding stream
- Creates international presence for terrorist organization
- Separate from weekly Kabul deliveries ($44-87M)

### Total U.S. Funding Through Qatar

**Calculation:**
- $10 million/month × 12 months × 11 years = $1.32 billion minimum
- This is separate from other funding streams
- Continues even after Taliban takeover
- No oversight or accountability

### Doha Agreement Context

**Secret Annexes:**
- Doha deal has secret annexes never released
- Adams: "Congress needs to release them because it's time we know what they say"
- Likely contain details on funding commitments
- May explain continued payments to designated terrorists

### Hamas Connection

**Marwan Issa (Hamas Representative):**
- Hamas representative sent from Gaza to Libya
- Released December 2023 by Prime Minister Dbeibah (Libya)
- "All over press" because Dbeibah released them
- **Got private plane from Tripoli to Qatar**
- Demonstrates Qatar's role in Hamas support network

### Qatar as Financial Hub

**Strategic Position:**
- Hosts Taliban political office
- Provides financial services
- Transit point for terrorist financing
- International legitimacy provider
- Coordinates with other state sponsors

**U.S. Relationship:**
- Qatar is U.S. ally
- Hosts major U.S. military base (Al Udeid)
- Simultaneously supports Taliban and Hamas
- U.S. tolerates or enables this support
- Creates policy contradictions

---

## U.S. Funding to Taliban and Al-Qaeda

### Weekly Cash Deliveries to Kabul

**Amount:**
- Initial reports: $40 million per week
- **Revised estimates: $44-87 million per week**
- Large discrepancy in actual amount
- Source: U.S. State Department via NGOs

**Confirmation:**
- Sarah Adams confirmed
- "Legend" broke the $44-87M figure
- Scott Mann confirmed
- Ahmad Massoud confirmed
- Congressional testimony ignored

**Process:**
1. Money taken from weekly plane to Kabul
2. Brought to Afghanistan International Bank
3. Bank makes huge money from exchange of this volume
4. Supposedly distributed to humanitarian aid
5. **Reality: 70% siphoned off to Taliban-only causes, majority to Taliban military**

### Taliban Siphoning Methods

**1. Basic Bribes:**
- Doesn't account for 70% siphoning
- Small-scale corruption

**2. Board Membership Requirement:**
- Every NGO collecting from this fund must have Taliban representative on board
- Complete control of money distribution
- Systematic control mechanism

**3. NGO Infiltration:**
- Long-standing NGOs with State Department relationships
- Taliban "gutted them completely, put all Taliban in them"
- State Department claims "12-year relationship, good record"
- "None of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"
- U.S. not being honest about infiltration

**4. Taliban Martyr Payments:**
- **U.S. paying welfare to Taliban martyr families**
- Every Taliban member who died fighting U.S. forces
- U.S. government paying stipend to family
- American Gold Star families "aren't getting squat"
- Justification given: "It'll stop them from joining ISIS"
- Adams' response: "The Taliban guy is already dead"

### Eight Direct Delivery Stops

Adams' team "followed the money" - identified eight specific recipients of weekly deliveries:

**Stop 1: Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. and international law)
- Longtime Mullah Omar supporter
- Very wealthy from Taliban funds
- Heavy investments in Pakistan
- Has cancer, going to Pakistan for treatment

**Stop 2: Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist
- Went to Iran and made deal with Iranians and Al-Qaeda
- Deal: Send Al-Qaeda fighters to attack U.S. and Israeli troops in Iraq/Syria
- **Huge violation of Doha deal**

**Stop 3: GDI (Taliban CIA) - Abdul Haq Wasiq**
- **Status:** Designated terrorist

**Summary:**
> "Every single delivery except one was a building, every single one of those terrorists are sanctioned, every delivery is against U.S. law"

**All four senior leaders of Al-Qaeda receive U.S. cash deliveries from airplane**

### Additional Funding Streams

**1. Taliban Political Office in Qatar:**
- At least $10 million per month
- Funded by U.S. since 2013
- Separate from weekly Kabul deliveries
- 11+ years of continuous funding

**2. Supreme Leader's Office Budget:**
- Hibatullah Akhundzada total annual budget: $48 million
- U.S. contribution: Approximately $3 million per month
- Source: "Counterterrorism dollars"
- **U.S. covers nearly his entire office budget**

**3. Refugee Program Fraud:**
- Run by: Khalil Haqqani (uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani)
- Official role: Head of refugees for Taliban
- Claimed purpose: Resettling Afghan refugees returning from Pakistan to Nangarhar
- **Actual use: Funding Al-Qaeda training camps**
- Amount: $5 million per month
- Recipient: Abdulaziz Haqqani delivers directly to Al-Qaeda camps
- Source: Humanitarian aid dollars
- Camps contain: Libyan fighters and other foreign nationals

### Where the Money Goes

**Primary Recipients:**

**1. Sirajuddin Haqqani:**
- Receives 5-6 times more than Supreme Leader
- Approximately $15-18 million per month
- Taliban Interior Minister and Haqqani Network leader
- Controls security apparatus
- Coordinates with ISIS-K
- Protects ISIS-K Branch Two (threat to Russia)

**2. Hibatullah Akhundzada:**
- Approximately $3 million per month
- Supreme Leader of Taliban (Kandahari Taliban faction)
- Also receives from Iran, Russia, India, China

**3. Al-Qaeda Training Camps:**
- Minimum $5 million per month through refugee program
- Additional unknown amounts through other channels
- **Training terrorists for U.S. homeland attacks**
- Training terrorists for European attacks
- Training terrorists for embassy attacks
- Training terrorists for Syria operations

**4. TTP (Pakistani Taliban):**
- Funded through GDI "Immigrants Department"
- Conducted 800 attacks in Pakistan last year
- Afghan Taliban rotating units into TTP
- Part of Fat War plan

**5. Al-Qaeda Senior Leadership:**
- Direct payments to Bin Laden family
- Payments to Saif al-Adel
- Support for Islamic Army operations
- Funding for global terrorist operations

### Total Annual U.S. Funding to Taliban/Al-Qaeda

**Conservative Calculation:**

- Weekly Kabul deliveries: $44M (low estimate) × 52 weeks = **$2.288 billion/year**
- Qatar political office: $10M × 12 months = **$120 million/year**
- Supreme Leader office: $3M × 12 months = **$36 million/year**
- Refugee fraud: $5M × 12 months = **$60 million/year**

**Total: Minimum $2.504 billion per year**

**High Estimate (using $87M weekly):**
- Weekly: $87M × 52 weeks = **$4.524 billion/year**
- Plus other streams: **$216 million/year**
- **Total: $4.740 billion per year**

### Al-Qaeda's Ironic Propaganda

**Messaging:**
- Makes jokes about U.S. funding going to camps training homeland attackers
- Insider joke: "America is funding its own attack"
- **Propaganda angle: Will portray as "inside job" by U.S. government**
- Goal: Make Americans distrust their government
- Plans to incorporate conspiracy theory elements into attacks
- Make conspiracy theorists view Al-Qaeda as "revolutionaries and rebels"

**Building Seven Reference:**
- Al-Qaeda found 9/11 conspiracy theories "fascinating"
- Actively studies American conspiracy communities
- Similar to Hamas supporter dynamics

### Congressional Inaction

**Petition Results:**
- 382,000+ signatures collected
- Submitted to Congress
- **Result: Zero action taken**

**Legislative Efforts:**

**1. House Bill - Congressman Burchett:**
- Bill introduced to stop Taliban funding
- Status: Sitting in Senate with no sponsor
- No senator picked it up to shepherd through process

**2. Terrorist Designation Bill - Congresswoman Nancy Mace:**
- Purpose: Designate Taliban as terrorist organization
- Status: Dead
- Opposition: Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose
- Result: Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists

**Congressional Leadership Failure:**

**Congressman Michael McCaul (Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee):**
- Recent incident: Public intoxication at airport
- Known issue: Insider trading allegations
- Action on Taliban funding: None
- Pattern: Brings witnesses for "five-minute sound clips"
- No follow-through or accountability measures
- No action following testimony of Tyler Andrew Vargas or others

### Theory Behind Continued Funding

**Adams' Assessment:**
Some members of Congress may believe the Haqqani Network (particularly Sirajuddin Haqqani) can be used as a conduit against Russia, particularly regarding Ukraine war. This is the only logical explanation for unprecedented funding levels.

**The Ruse:**
- U.S. believes it's playing Kandahari Taliban against Haqqani Network
- Reality: Both factions communicate daily via Telegram
- They coordinate all approvals and information sharing
- Present fake internal conflicts to U.S. officials
- U.S. wastes resources on non-existent political crisis
- Real issues ignored: terrorism, murders, women's apartheid

### Why U.S. Continues Funding (Adams' Theories)

1. **Terror sympathizing problem**
2. **Incompetence**
3. **Money laundering** - "People make money off of it, is an incentive"
4. **Politics** - "People care about politics more than country"
5. **No accountability** - "No one will be honest and say this is wrong, fix it"
6. **Partisanship** - "Well if my party is doing it, maybe it's wrong but at least it's my party"

**Adams:**
> "We're in a very divided country but it's both parties doing this. They're benefiting by dividing us and we participate in it every time we allude to it or die on a hill for one of these losers representing us."

- Only 8 days from planning to execution
- Demonstrates rapid operational capability

### Intelligence Sharing Hub

**Confirmed Intelligence Sharing:**
- 100% confirmed intelligence sharing between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian government receives intelligence from terrorist groups
- Terrorists receive intelligence from Iran
- Multiple state actors sharing with terrorists
- Terrorists sharing with multiple state actors

**Coordination:**
- Real-time operational planning
- Attack approval processes
- Resource allocation
- Strategic direction
- Tactical coordination

### Power Dynamics

**Adams' Assessment:**
> "Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are power players. People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country by our enemies. They're treating them with respect. They're saying what can you do for me, what can I do for you."

**Strategic Implications:**
- "To them, they beat us"
- Taliban/Al-Qaeda seen as equals by state actors
- Not patron-client relationship
- More like peer collaboration
- Each party bringing different capabilities
- Mutual benefit relationships

### What Makes Kandahar Unique

### Historical Context

**October 7, 2001:**
- Operation Enduring Freedom announced
- U.S. began carpet bombing Kandahar
- Direct Afghanistan connection to October 7, 2023 date choice
- Symbolic importance for Al-Qaeda and Taliban

**Current Significance:**
- Kandahar is center of anti-U.S. coordination
- Where state actors and terrorists meet
- Where attacks are planned
- Where relationships are built
- Where future operations are coordinated

**This is unprecedented in modern terrorism - a geographic hub where multiple hostile state actors regularly coordinate with terrorist organizations for operational planning**

## NGOs and Humanitarian Organizations

### Role in Migration Routes

**Darien Gap (Panama):**

**NGO Presence:**
- Non-governmental organizations provide humanitarian assistance along migration routes
- Unintentionally assist illegal migrants and potential threats
- Create "security blankets" that make journey easier
- Provide cover and association that changes security situation
- Increase migration volume by improving route safety

**Impact:**
- Makes dangerous journey more survivable
- Encourages more migration
- Terrorists use same NGO services as economic migrants
- NGOs cannot distinguish terrorists from legitimate refugees
- Inadvertently enable terrorist travel to U.S.

**Adams' Assessment:**
Mix of incompetence and misguided "white savior complex"

### Kabul Evacuation Example

**2021 Afghanistan Withdrawal:**
- 120,000 people evacuated
- Approximately 70,000 with unknown identities
- Due to NGO pressure to accept people without proper identification
- "Don't ask for ID, it's racist"
- "They're fleeing for their lives"
- Result: No vetting of thousands

**Security Implications:**
- Unknown individuals brought to U.S.
- No background checks possible
- No way to verify claims
- Terrorists potentially included
- Years later, impossible to determine who came in

### TikTok as Human Trafficking Tool

**Revolutionary Discovery:**
Chinese and African migrants using TikTok as human trafficking/smuggling application

**TikTok Provides:**
- Route planning through multiple countries
- Border crossing instructions
- Visa acquisition guidance
- Flight information to South America
- Location of aid stations and medical facilities
- **Identification of friendly NGOs along route**
- Complete routing from origin to U.S. southern border

**Adams' Comparison:**
Like how U.S. military would use AAC (automated air coordination) for movement planning

**NGO Inadvertent Complicity:**
- NGOs listed on TikTok as "friendly"
- Migrants know which NGOs will help without questions
- Terrorists use same information
- NGOs become part of terrorist travel infrastructure

### Refugee Program Exploitation

**Taliban Refugee Fraud Scheme:**

**Run By:** Khalil Haqqani (uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani)

**Official Role:** Head of refugees for Taliban

**Claimed Purpose:** Resettling Afghan refugees returning from Pakistan to Nangarhar

**Actual Use:**
- **Funding Al-Qaeda training camps**
- Amount: $5 million per month
- Source: U.S. humanitarian aid dollars
- Recipient: Abdulaziz Haqqani delivers directly to camps
- Camps contain: Libyan fighters and other foreign nationals training for U.S. attacks

**How It Works:**
1. U.S. provides humanitarian aid for refugee resettlement
2. NGOs distribute funds per agreement
3. Taliban-controlled "refugee program" receives funds
4. Money diverted to Al-Qaeda training camps
5. No actual refugee services provided
6. Complete fraud using humanitarian cover

### NGO Infiltration by Taliban

**State Department Relationships:**
- Long-standing NGOs with 12+ year State Department relationships
- State Department trusts these organizations
- Claims "good record" of humanitarian work

**Taliban Takeover:**
- Taliban "gutted them completely, put all Taliban in them"
- Original staff gone
- "None of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"
- Operating under same NGO names
- State Department not honest about this

**Board Membership Requirement:**
- Every NGO collecting from U.S. aid fund must have Taliban representative on board
- Taliban complete control of money distribution
- Systematic control mechanism
- NGOs cannot operate without Taliban approval/participation

### South American Visa Facilitation

**Countries Facilitating Travel:**
- **Brazil** - Easy to get humanitarian visa
- **Colombia**
- **Ecuador** - Allows Chinese citizens to enter without visa
- **Panama** - Darien Gap crossing point

**Critical Policy:**
Ecuador allows Chinese citizens to enter without a visa, contributing to 6,000% increase in Chinese nationals at U.S. border.

**Adams' Recommendation:**
1. Pressure South American countries to require visas for Chinese nationals
2. Leverage U.S. aid as diplomatic tool
3. Address pipeline further south rather than only at border

**NGO Role:**
- Provide services to all migrants in these countries
- Cannot distinguish terrorists from economic migrants
- Inadvertently enable terrorist travel
- Part of infrastructure terrorists exploit

### Unintentional Support Mechanisms

**How NGOs Inadvertently Help Terrorists:**

**1. Humanitarian Services:**
- Food, water, medical care along routes
- Makes journey survivable
- No questions asked policy
- Cannot screen for terrorists

**2. Information Sharing:**
- NGO locations known and publicized
- Terrorists know where to find help
- TikTok lists "friendly" NGOs
- Becomes part of smuggling infrastructure

**3. Documentation Assistance:**
- Help with visa applications
- Provide letters of support
- Character references
- Refugee status applications
- Terrorists use same services

**4. Legal Advocacy:**
- Fight deportations
- Provide legal representation
- Advocate for lenient immigration policies
- Apply same advocacy to terrorists as legitimate refugees

**5. Integration Services:**
- Housing assistance
- Job placement
- English language training
- Community integration
- Terrorists access same services

### Afghan Evac Coalition - Government Control Mechanism

**Creation:**
Government created coalition to quiet dissenting volunteer voices after withdrawal.

**Function:**
- "Partnership between the government and all these NGOs"
- State Department controls narrative
- Keeps volunteer groups quiet
- Must sign "tons of NDAs"
- Adams left after third NDA

**Purpose:**
- "To keep the volunteer groups in line"
- "To make them mentally happy"
- "It is a cover to drag out the evac 100%"
- Still meeting two years later (2023)
- No actual rescue operations
- Controls narrative about who was left behind

**Government Response to Volunteers:**
- Government plan: "We left 100 Americans behind"
- Volunteer groups compiled data across organizations
- Cross-group tally: "8,000 Americans are left behind"
- Government created coalition to prevent this type of coordinated fact-finding
- Adams' organization (Moral Compass Federation) stayed independent

### Recommendations

**Adams' Position:**
- NGOs filling gap where governments should operate
- Unintentional consequences of humanitarian work
- Need better screening mechanisms
- Need government accountability for who enters countries
- Cannot rely on NGOs to do security vetting
- Governments must control borders, not NGOs

**Security vs. Humanitarianism:**
- Legitimate refugees need help
- Terrorists exploit humanitarian systems
- NGOs cannot make security determinations
- Government responsibility to vet
- NGOs should provide services after government vetting
- Current system allows terrorist exploitation

## International Coordination of October 7th

### Planning Timeline and State Actor Involvement

**March 2022: Planning Began**
- Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine (February 2022)
- Terrorists believed world focus on Ukraine created opportunity
- **Reached out to Russia for approval**
- **Russia encouraged attack: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"**
- Russia wanted attack to relieve Ukraine war pressure

**Original Target Date: October 7, 2022**
- **Significance:** Anniversary of Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- October 7, 2001: George Bush announced operation, began carpet bombing Kandahar
- **This connects October 7th directly to Afghanistan, not Israel**
- Most Americans don't recognize this connection

**July 31, 2022: Delay Decision**
- U.S. drone strike killed Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul
- Al-Qaeda feared U.S. would bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Worried about losing safe haven
- **Reached out to Russia requesting they continue pressure for 2022 attack**
- Russia wanted attack to happen (Ukraine pressure relief)
- Al-Qaeda decided to delay to 2023 anyway

**Revised Target Date: October 7, 2023**
- Attack delayed exactly one year
- Gave attackers additional year of training
- Actually beneficial due to more training time
- Same symbolic date maintained

### Training Location and Oversight

**Training Location:** Afghanistan camps

**Numbers Trained:** 1,500 fighters (originally planned 500)

**Training Dates:**
- **Started:** August 7, 2022

- Chose October 7th date for Afghanistan connection

**Taliban:**
- **Hibatullah Akhundzada (Supreme Leader):** Issued fatwa authorizing attack
- Provided training camps in Afghanistan
- Logistical support
- Coordination with other groups
- Protected planning meetings

**Iran/IRGC:**
- **Mohammad Kazemi:** Key plotter, operations coordinator
  - Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
  - Previously protected Al-Qaeda leaders in Iran
  - Also masterminding Soleimani assassination revenge plot
  - Traveled to Afghanistan for planning meetings
  - **Not on FBI Most Wanted List** (major intelligence failure)
- **Various IRGC generals:** Gave go-ahead authority for attack
- **Internal Iranian military units:** Participated in planning
- Intelligence and logistics support
- Coordination infrastructure

**Hamas:**
- Ground execution force
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Received training in Afghanistan
- Took operational direction from Al-Qaeda/Taliban/Iran coordination

**Russia:**
- Approved timing of attack
- Encouraged execution despite delay concerns
- Wanted attack to relieve Ukraine war pressure
- Pushed for 2022 execution when Al-Qaeda wanted to delay
- Provided tacit approval for operation

### Planning Meetings Location

**First Meeting: Kandahar, Afghanistan**
- Key decision makers present:
  - Saif al-Adel (Al-Qaeda military commission head)
  - Mohammad Kazemi (IRGC Intelligence Organization head)
  - Taliban leadership
  - IRGC generals
- **Chose the date: October 7th**
- Selected for Afghanistan connection (Operation Enduring Freedom anniversary)
- Hibatullah Akhundzada issued fatwa
- Initial operational planning

**Second Meeting: Kabul, Afghanistan**
- Refinement of operational details
- Logistics coordination
- Final approvals

**Subsequent Planning:**
- Primarily via Telegram
- Demonstrates vulnerability in communications security
- Should have been interceptable by intelligence services
- Continued coordination between state actors and terrorists

### Warning Signs Ignored

**Information Provided to Israel:**
- People observed Hamas terrorists training in Afghanistan
- Reports provided to Israeli government before attack
- Israel knew Hamas was planning "some big plot" in Afghanistan
- **No action taken by Israel**

**Adams' Warning:**
> "I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake."

**Foreign Intelligence Confirmation:**
- European intelligence service contacted Adams through intermediary
- Message: "Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."
- Confirms foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question: Does U.S. government have it and not preparing America?

### Why Most Americans Don't Know

**U.S. Press:**
- Has not covered Al-Qaeda/Taliban involvement
- No major U.S. media reporting on October 7th's true origins
- Information available in British, European, Indian, African press
- **Not in American media**

**U.S. Government:**
- Not preparing American law enforcement
- Not sharing threat information
- Governor Ron DeSantis: "I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from the federal government"
- State and local law enforcement unaware

**Israel's Position:**
- Nearly one year after attack, Israel still not disclosing Al-Qaeda/Taliban involvement
- Israel struck IRGC targets but not Al-Qaeda or Taliban
- Maintaining false narrative

### Significance for U.S. Homeland Attacks

**October 7th as Template:**
- First in series of waves targeting Israel, Europe, and United States
- "Test run" for tactics to be used in U.S.
- Same planning structure (Afghanistan coordination with state actors)
- Same coordination methods (IRGC + Al-Qaeda + Taliban)
- Same attack style being prepared for U.S.

**Training Correlation:**
- U.S. homeland attackers received similar training in Afghanistan
- Advanced urban warfare
- Suicide bombing techniques
- Cover and covert operations
- **Same camps, same instructors, same methods**
- Same state actor coordination

**Tactics to Expect in U.S.:**
- Swarming attacks (multiple simultaneous targets)
- Combination of suicide bombers and fedayeen fighters
- Real-time intelligence and coordination
- Ability to change targets during operation
- Extended engagement (fighters will fight to death)
- Based on October 7th and 2008 Mumbai attacks

**The Afghanistan Connection:**
> "Everybody who's like why do we care about Israel why is that our problem - that's just the first in the series that's coming for us. That's like the test run."

### Multi-State Approval Process

**Unprecedented Coordination:**
- Multiple hostile state actors approved same operation
- Russia (Ukraine war advantage)
- Iran (anti-Israel, anti-U.S. goals)
- Taliban (Afghanistan connection, training camps)
- Al-Qaeda (overall operational planning)

**Approval Hierarchy:**
1. Al-Qaeda operational planners designed attack
2. Taliban Supreme Leader issued religious fatwa
3. Iran IRGC generals gave operational go-ahead
4. Russia approved timing
5. Hamas executed on ground

**This level of international state actor coordination for a terrorist attack is unprecedented in modern terrorism**

### Date Significance Research

**October 7th (2001):**
- Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- U.S. began carpet bombing Kandahar
- **Direct Afghanistan connection most Americans don't recognize**
- This is why Al-Qaeda chose October 7th

**August 7th (1998):**
- Tanzania and Kenya embassy bombings
- Training for October 7th began on this anniversary
- Demonstrates historical continuity

**September 11 (1922):**
Most Americans don't know why 9/11 was chosen:
- British Mandate began
- First time Westerner (British and Jewish) put in charge of Palestinian mandate
- Al-Qaeda cared about date from 1922
- Not about "school year starting" or "9-1-1" or "Allah"

**Implication:**
Terrorists choose dates based on historical significance to them, not us. Many potential dates from:
- 20 years of Afghanistan/Iraq wars
- Syria war events
- Terrorist martyrs
- Historical grievances going back 100+ years

### Intelligence Failures

**Israel's Failure:**
- Had warnings about Hamas training in Afghanistan
- Knew Hamas planning "some big plot" in Afghanistan
- Did not act on intelligence
- Did not connect Afghanistan to imminent threat
- Same pattern now with U.S. homeland attack warnings

**U.S. Pattern:**
- Same types of reports being passed to U.S. government
- About Al-Qaeda training for U.S. attacks in Afghanistan
- U.S. not taking seriously
- Same mistakes as Israel
- Governors receiving zero threat information from federal government

**Communications Intelligence:**
- Planning conducted partly via Telegram
- Should have been interceptable
- Intelligence services apparently not collecting or not analyzing
- Adams' team found information through open sources
- Why didn't classified intelligence services?

## Financial Networks and Money Laundering

### U.S. Weekly Cash Deliveries - The Plane

**The Process:**

**Step 1: The Plane Arrives**
- Weekly flight to Kabul
- Publicly stated: $40 million per week
- **Actual amount: $43-87 million per week** (large discrepancy)

**Step 2: Initial Distribution**
- Money taken from plane
- Brought to Afghanistan International Bank
- Bank makes huge money from exchange of this volume

**Step 3: Supposed Distribution**
- Officially: Goes to humanitarian aid
- **Reality: 70% siphoned off to Taliban-only causes**
- Majority goes to Taliban military
- Remainder to various Taliban/Al-Qaeda entities

**Step 4: Eight Additional Destinations**
Adams' team "followed the money" - money from plane doesn't all go to Afghan International Bank, goes to eight other destinations weekly:

1. Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund (designated terrorist)
2. Deputy PM Mullah Baradar (designated terrorist)
3. GDI - Abdul Haq Wasiq (designated terrorist, holds Americans hostage)
4. Ministry of Interior - Sirajuddin Haqqani (designated terrorist)
5. Sirajuddin Haqqani's personal residence
6. Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada
7. Al-Qaeda Military Commission - Saif al-Adel
8. The Bin Laden Brothers (Hamza, Saad, Abdullah)

**Every delivery except one was to a designated terrorist**
**Every delivery violates U.S. and international law**

### Taliban Siphoning Mechanisms

**1. Board Membership Control:**
- Every NGO collecting from fund must have Taliban representative on board
- Complete control of money distribution
- Taliban approve all expenditures
- No NGO can operate without Taliban participation

**2. NGO Infiltration:**
- Long-standing NGOs with State Department relationships
- Taliban "gutted them completely"
- Put Taliban members in all positions
- Operating under same NGO names
- State Department claims "12-year relationship, good record"
- Reality: "None of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"

**3. Refugee Program Fraud:**
- **$5 million per month** diverted to Al-Qaeda training camps
- Run by Khalil Haqqani (Sirajuddin's uncle)
- Official: Refugee resettlement program
- Actual: Direct funding to Al-Qaeda camps training U.S. homeland attackers
- Delivered by Abdulaziz Haqqani to camps
- Camps contain Libyan fighters and other foreign nationals

**4. Taliban Martyr Payments:**
- U.S. paying stipends to families of Taliban killed fighting U.S. forces
- The fighter is already dead
- Justification: "It'll stop them from joining ISIS"
- American Gold Star families receive nothing comparable

### Chinese Investment Money

**Amount:** $10 billion investment in Afghanistan

**Distribution Formula:**
> "$3 of every $10 gets allocated to Al-Qaeda" = **$3 billion to Al-Qaeda**

**Al-Qaeda Distribution:**
- Al-Qaeda keeps some for operations
- Gives some to affiliates:
  - TTP (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan)
  - IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan)
- IMU sending terrorists to U.S. southern border

**What China Gets:**
- Lithium mining rights
- Uranium mining rights
- Belt and Road corridor through Afghanistan
- Intelligence on Uighurs from Taliban
- Long-term proxy force development

## Supply Chains and Logistics

### Terrorist Travel Routes to United States

**Primary Route:**
Afghanistan → Iran → Turkey → Brazil → Darien Gap (Panama) → U.S. Southern Border

**Confirmed Groups Using Route:**
1. **ISIS:** 8 members confirmed
   - Procured Afghan passports
   - Sole purpose: Reach U.S. southern border

2. **Haqqani Network:** 25-50 members
   - Passports through Ministry of Interior connections
   - Sirajuddin Haqqani runs Ministry

3. **Al-Qaeda:** Multiple groups
   - Specific numbers not disclosed
   - Same routes as other organizations

**Why This Route:**
- **Iran:** Transit point, safe passage
- **Turkey:** Key transit hub, visa services
- **Brazil:** "Easy to get humanitarian Brazil visa"
- **Darien Gap:** Choke point - "where they're all going through"
- **No real security** to prevent progression northward

### The Darien Gap - Panama

**Location and Significance:**
- Panama jungle between South and Central America
- "Your choke point where they're all going through"
- All terrorist groups use this route
- Massive human migration corridor

**Dangers:**
- Murders, rapes, robberies
- Animal attacks (large wild cats, cougars)
- Diseases
- Panamanian authorities (torture and abuse upon capture)
- "Super dangerous"

**Survival Rate:**
> "If 10 Afghans go in, maybe six come out"

**Environment:**
- Jungle terrain
- Extreme poverty in region
- "Real wild wild west"
- "So many criminals going through it"
- NGOs provide assistance along route

**Who's Traveling:**
- Economic migrants (majority)
- Terrorists (confirmed multiple groups)
- Criminal elements
- Smugglers and guides
- Exploitation victims

### Document Procurement and Fraud

**Afghan Passports:**
- Taliban government issuing to non-Afghans
- "Sole purpose of coming to our southern border"
- Systematic process
- Ministry of Interior (Haqqani Network) controls
- Can provide documentation to large groups

**False Identities:**
- Pakistani using Afghan Taliban passport
- U.S. assumes they're Afghan
- Completely wrong identity
- May not even have correct ethnicity listed
- Biometrics don't match U.S. databases

**Musa (Al-Qaeda Document Forger):**
- NUMBER ONE TARGET of Benghazi investigation
- Makes all fake travel documents for Al-Qaeda external operatives
- Now in Afghanistan
- Works for Sirajuddin Haqqani in Ministry of Interior
- Makes passports for terrorists leaving Afghanistan
- "One man who knows every terrorist Al-Qaeda is deploying from Afghanistan"
- U.S. has "no interest in him"

**Turkish Documents:**
- Easy to obtain through fraud
- Grant Europe access (Schengen zone)
- Musa specialized in Turkish document fraud
- Khorasan Group used Turkish documents
- Al-Badri Brigade (Manchester bombing, Bataclan) used Turkish documents

### Weapons Supply Chains

**Libya to Multiple Theaters:**

**Libya as Weapons Hub:**
- "One of best places in world to buy weapons"
- **Not 2011-2012 Gaddafi stockpiles** - those are old
- Buying brand new weapons

**Weapons Sources:**
1. **Serbia**
2. **Ukraine** (weapons from Ukraine definitely reaching Libya)
3. **Turkey** (primary transit point)

**Ukraine Weapons:**
- Unknown if specifically U.S.-provided weapons
- Could be from either side (Ukraine or Russia)
- "Corruption on both sides"
- Weapons reaching terrorists in Libya confirmed

**Haqqani Weapons Purchase:**
- Haqqani Network delegation from Afghanistan to Libya to buy weapons
- May be buying from Al-Qaeda (rich, might give free to fellow terrorists)
- May be buying non-U.S. origin weapons
- Pakistan complaints about TTP having M4s, M16s marked "Property of US Government"
- Haqqani going to Libya may be for different origin weapons (plausible deniability)

**Types Purchased:**
- Russian PKT heavy machine guns
- 150mm and 160mm artillery shells
- Large supplies, not man-portable
- For sustained operations

**Historical Weapons:**
- **Russian SA-7s, SA-9s** (surface-to-air missiles)
- From Gaddafi stockpiles in Libya
- Moved through Turkey to various conflicts
- Some found in terrorist arsenals

### Syria Supply Chain

**Libya to Syria Route:**
- If moving weapons to Syria, go through **Turkey**
- Not through Benghazi for Syria operations
- Turkey serves as transit hub
- Multiple militant groups use this route

**Al-Qaeda Syria Deployment:**
- 10,000 fighters sent from Afghanistan to Syria
- Taliban provided training camps
- Logistics coordination for deployment
- Musa (document forger) "one of big logistics guys for Syria fighters"
- "Al-Qaeda's Lord of War" (Adams' team report title)

### Russian Supply Chain for U.S. Homeland Attack

**Adams' Statement:**
> "Their pipeline is helping move some of Al-Qaeda's supplies into the United States for the Homeland attack."

**Details:**
- Russian channels/pipelines being used
- Moving specific supplies (type known to Adams but not disclosed)
- Into United States
- For Al-Qaeda homeland attack
- Provides Russia plausible deniability
- Will be blamed on ISIS, not Russia

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- Asymmetric response to U.S. aid to Ukraine
- Use terrorists as proxies
- Perfect deniability

### Chinese Supply Chain - Uranium

**Afghanistan Uranium Mines:**
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"
- Chinese personnel on site

**Co-location:**
- Al-Qaeda operatives present at mines
- IRGC representatives present
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, and Al-Qaeda

**Purpose:**
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- "Not exactly" nuclear weapons
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- Chinese aware and allowing
- May be providing expertise

**Supply Chain Implications:**
- Material control loose
- State actor facilitating terrorist access
- Long-term capability development
- "Think of that as they innovate on that and grow"

### Medical Treatment Routes

**Turkey Medical Services:**
- Terrorists travel to Turkey for medical treatment
- Example: Terrorist who lost leg traveled regularly to Turkey
- "He'd been traveling back and forth to Turkey for treatment"
- Medical visa cover for travel
- Allows continued operations

**Pakistan Medical Services:**
- Prime Minister Hassan Akhund has cancer
- Going to Pakistan for treatment
- "Educated/good doctors fled Afghanistan"
- Medical travel as cover for other operations

### Training Camp Logistics

**Supply to 30 Al-Qaeda Camps in Afghanistan:**

**12th Department of GDI Responsibilities:**
1. Protect all 30 Al-Qaeda training camps
2. Vet all new recruits (Afghan, Jordanian, Syrian, Egyptian)
3. Move all new trainees (into camps, between locations)
4. Move Al-Qaeda senior leadership
5. Harbor senior leadership in GDI houses
6. **Protect Al-Qaeda cash holdings in Afghanistan** (very large holdings)
7. **Control all border movements for Al-Qaeda**

**Supplies Needed:**
- Weapons for training
- Ammunition
- Food for trainees
- Infrastructure materials
- Communications equipment
- "Invisible bomb vest" components
- Explosives for suicide bombing training

**Foreign Fighter Travel:**
- Multiple nationalities training (Libyan, Syrian, Egyptian, etc.)
- Travel facilitated by Musa (document forger)
- GDI controls border movements
- Systematic infiltration and exfiltration
- Ready for deployment worldwide

### Human Smuggling Networks

**TikTok as Coordination Tool:**
- Chinese and African migrants using TikTok
- Provides complete routing information:
  - Routes through multiple countries
  - Border crossing instructions
  - Visa acquisition guidance
  - Flight information to South America
  - Aid station locations
  - Medical facility locations
  - **Friendly NGO identification**
  - Complete route from origin to U.S. border

**NGO Inadvertent Support:**
- NGOs listed on TikTok as helpful
- Provide humanitarian assistance
- Cannot distinguish terrorists from migrants
- Create "security blankets" along route
- Make dangerous journey survivable

**Commercial Networks:**
- Smugglers and guides
- Transportation providers
- Document forgers
- Safe house operators
- Bribery networks at borders
- Complete commercial infrastructure

### Intelligence and Communications

**Telegram Usage:**
- October 7th planning conducted partly via Telegram
- Taliban Kandahari and Haqqani factions coordinate daily via Telegram
- Should be interceptable by intelligence services
- Apparently not being monitored effectively

**Courier Networks:**
- Physical document delivery
- Cash movement
- Message relay when electronic communication risky
- Traditional methods still used

**Meeting Coordination:**
- Kandahar as regular meeting location
- State actors (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea) travel there
- Face-to-face planning
- Harder to intercept than electronic communications

### Border Crossing Methods

**Southern U.S. Border:**
- Fake documents (Afghan, Syrian, Turkish passports)
- U.S. Border Patrol agents mostly haven't been overseas
- Cannot identify fake documents
- Cannot identify wrong nationalities
- Example: Egyptian with Syrian passport - agent won't know
- "Passport says Syrian" - passes through

**Legal Immigration (Al-Qaeda Preference):**
- "Clean" terrorists from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan
- Apply for legitimate tourist/travel visas
- Goal: "Embarrass system again like 9/11 attackers"
- Can fly directly to U.S.
- Legal status = less scrutiny
- Can wait indefinitely without suspicion

**Timeline Examples:**
- Fastest Afghan to U.S. border illegally: 3 weeks
- Legal visa route: Can fly day after visa approved
- Depends on method and passport used

### Summary: Multi-National Supply Chain

**What Makes This Different:**
- State actors providing logistics normally only available to states
- Russian supply channels
- Chinese resource access
- Iranian intelligence and coordination
- Pakistani safe havens and bases
- Turkish transit and documents
- Qatar financial services
- Combined: terrorists have state-level logistics capability

**Result:**
More sophisticated, resilient, and capable terrorist operations than ever seen before. Not just terrorist networks - terrorist networks backed by multiple hostile state actors providing complementary capabilities.

## The Islamic Army - Unified Command Structure

### Formation and Leadership

**Created:** Last two years under Hamza bin Laden's leadership

**Significance:**
- Fulfills Osama bin Laden's original vision
- Now operational reality, not just aspiration
- "Most significant development in global terrorism structure"

**Command Structure:**
- **Overall Leader:** Hamza bin Laden (Osama's son)
- **Military Commander:** Hamza al-Ghamdi (former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden)
- Al-Ghamdi appointed by Hamza bin Laden
- Al-Ghamdi has $5 million FBI reward
- Hamza bin Laden only has $1 million reward (organizational failure indicator)

### Composition - Breaking Sectarian Divides

**Revolutionary Aspect:** Sunni AND Shia groups working together

**Member Organizations:**
- **Al-Qaeda** (Sunni)
- **ISIS** (Sunni, including ISIS Khorasan Province)
- **Taliban** (Sunni)
- **Hamas** (Sunni, historically backed by Iran)
- **Hezbollah** (Shia)
- **Iranian IRGC elements** (Shia state)
- Any group willing to join

**Historical Significance:**
Breaks traditional Sunni-Shia sectarian warfare that defined Middle Eastern conflicts for decades.

### Training and Size

**Training Numbers:**
- Approximately 120,000 people trained under Islamic Army umbrella
- New recruits train in various camps
- Emerge identified as "Islamic Army" not specific organization
- When deployed (Syria, Somalia, Mali), fighters identify as Islamic Army
- If detained: "I'm Islamic Army" not "I'm Al-Qaeda" or "I'm ISIS"

**Recent Deployments:**
- October 7th (Israel): 1,500 fighters
- U.S. Homeland: 1,000 fighters
- Europe: 1,000 fighters
- Syria deployment: 10,000 fighters
- **Total recent operations: ~13,500 trained**

**Camp Organization:**
- 30+ Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan
- 7 camps: Suicide bomber training exclusively
- 23 camps: General training
- Some camps segregated by ethnicity
- All produce "Islamic Army" fighters

### Strategic Advantages

**1. Intelligence Confusion:**
- Fighters don't identify specific organization
- Prevents accurate attribution of attacks
- "Which group did this?" becomes unclear
- Protects safe havens by avoiding direct responsibility

**2. Operational Flexibility:**
- Can use different groups for different operations
- Al-Qaeda + ISIS + whoever suitable for mission
- Different groups claim responsibility
- Conceals true extent of coordination

**3. Ideological Bridge:**
- Brings Sunni and Shia together
- Common enemy (U.S., Israel, West)
- Shared goals despite different methods
- Compromise on traditional differences

### Territorial and Influence Agreements

**Al-Qaeda Concessions:**
- Given up desire to directly control territory
- Seeks political power and influence instead

**ISIS Agreement:**
- Al-Qaeda conceded territorial control to ISIS
- ISIS can run parts of Syria and Iraq
- Al-Qaeda retains political influence
- Compromise allows both to focus on strengths

**Iran/IRGC Agreement:**
- Similar territorial/influence sharing
- Joint operations planning (October 7th example)
- Resource sharing
- Intelligence cooperation

**Hezbollah Agreement:**
- Al-Qaeda/Hezbollah joint plot against U.S. interests in Lebanon
- Only Hezbollah will claim responsibility
- Al-Qaeda involvement remains hidden
- Preserves Al-Qaeda safe havens

### Operational Examples

**October 7th Hamas Attacks:**
- Planned by: Al-Qaeda + Taliban + Iran/IRGC
- Trained by: Taliban camps + Al-Qaeda instructors
- Executed by: Hamas (Islamic Army members)
- Russia approved timing
- Perfect example of Islamic Army coordination

**Syria Operations (Recent):**
- Al-Qaeda supported Jolani's blitz with 10,000 fighters
- Taliban provided training camps in Afghanistan
- No public acknowledgment of Al-Qaeda or Taliban
- Media reports only HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) actions
- Islamic Army members but different public attribution

**U.S. Homeland Attack (Planned):**
- Mix of Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters
- Both trained as "Islamic Army"
- ISIS will claim responsibility
- Protects Al-Qaeda safe havens
- Russia providing supply chain support
- Iran providing intelligence/coordination
- Multiple state actors supporting

**European Attacks (Planned):**
- Separate 1,000 Islamic Army fighters
- Coordinated with U.S. attacks
- State actor support (Russia, Iran)
- Attribution designed to confuse

### Goals and Strategy

**Primary Objectives (from Osama bin Laden):**

**1. Push U.S. Out of Middle East:**
- Embassy attacks
- October 7th-style operations
- Iraq/Syria operations
- Target: U.S. Embassy Baghdad specifically mentioned

**2. Restore the Caliphate:**
- Syria operations (10,000 fighters)
- Mali operations
- Somalia operations
- Full North Africa
- Eventually Spain (historical Islamic control reference)

**3. Economic Damage to West:**
- Infrastructure targets
- Transportation systems
- Economic symbols
- Bridges, metro systems, ports

**4. Homeland Attacks:**
- Bring war to American soil
- Mass casualty events
- Multiple simultaneous attacks
- Make Americans "feel the war zones at home"

**Methodology:**
- Use all terrorist groups collectively
- Not just Al-Qaeda achieving goals
- Collaborative operations appropriate to mission
- Different groups claim responsibility
- Conceals true coordination extent

### Hamza bin Laden vs. Osama bin Laden

**Leadership Style Differences:**

**1. Operational Tempo:**
- **Osama:** Patient, 5 years to approve 9/11
- **Hamza:** Approves operations in single meeting
- Example: Embassy attack plan - "brief it, I'm good, approved"
- IRGC complaints: "Hamza is loose cannon, moves too fast"

**2. Timeline:**
- **Osama:** Patient, willing to take 1,000 years for caliphate
- **Hamza:** Wants everything in his lifetime
- Wants Islamic caliphate created during his life
- Wants to fulfill all father's goals immediately

**3. Visibility:**
- **Osama:** Video messages, audio recordings, public figure
- **Hamza:** Completely hidden, no videos, no audio
- Wants "Hidden Hand" in all operations
- Groups won't claim responsibility for attacks he plans

**4. Philosophy:**
- **Osama:** Created vision and strategy
- **Hamza:** Focused on executing father's vision immediately
- Primary goal: "Take it to America on U.S. soil"
- Goes "full force" on homeland attacks

### International State Actor Integration

**Iran/IRGC:**
- Most deeply embedded
- Mohammad Kazemi coordinates directly with Hamza
- Intelligence sharing 100% confirmed
- Intelligence base inside Al-Qaeda camp
- Joint operational planning

**Russia:**
- Supply chain support for operations
- Approved October 7th timing
- Encouraging attacks for Ukraine advantage
- Supplies moving into U.S. for homeland attack

**China:**
- Long-term positioning
- Uranium mine access
- Resource extraction
- Building proxy relationships
- "Longer game" strategy

**North Korea:**
- Regular Kandahar meetings
- Part of anti-U.S. coordination
- Specific role less detailed

**Combined State Support:**
Creates unprecedented terrorist capability - terrorist motivation + state resources + international coordination.

### Negotiation and Compromise

**Hamza's Diplomatic Skills:**
- Constantly negotiating to bring groups into Islamic Army
- Groups give up certain demands to join
- Finding common ground despite historical conflicts
- Example: ISIS and Al-Qaeda were historical enemies, now cooperating

**What Groups Give Up:**
- Exclusive territorial control (Al-Qaeda concession)
- Public claiming of attacks (for operational security)
- Some ideological purity (Sunni-Shia cooperation)
- Independence (join unified command)

**What Groups Gain:**
- State-level resources and support
- Training camp access
- Safe havens in Afghanistan
- Intelligence sharing
- Weapons and supplies
- Financial support
- Protection from U.S. strikes (through attribution confusion)
- Part of larger strategic vision

### Strategic Assessment

**Why This Matters:**
- Unifies previously competing terrorist organizations
- Adds state-level capabilities
- Creates confusion for intelligence services
- Protects safe havens through attribution games
- Fulfills Osama bin Laden's original vision
- More dangerous than sum of parts
- Coordinated multi-theater operations
- Unprecedented in terrorism history

**Adams' Assessment:**
> "The Islamic Army is Hamza's creation, bringing together what his father envisioned. Now they're operational reality with state backing. This is the most significant development in global terrorism structure."

## Conclusions and Strategic Implications

### Unprecedented State-Terrorist Coordination

**The New Reality:**
Multiple near-peer and peer state actors (Iran, Russia, China, North Korea) now actively coordinate with and support terrorist networks at unprecedented levels. This is not traditional state sponsorship - it is integrated operational planning, resource sharing, and strategic coordination occurring in a specific geographic location (Kandahar, Afghanistan).

### Key Findings Summary

**1. Financial Support:**
- U.S. alone provides $2.5-4.7 billion annually to Taliban/Al-Qaeda
- China provides $10 billion investment ($3 billion to Al-Qaeda)
- Iran provides $145 million/month for Soleimani plot plus stipends
- Every U.S. weekly delivery goes to designated terrorists (violates U.S. law)

**2. Safe Havens:**
- Afghanistan serves as primary terrorist safe haven
- Iran harbored Al-Qaeda throughout 20-year U.S. war
- Pakistan provides bases for ISIS-K training camps
- No U.S. presence in Afghanistan to disrupt

**3. Intelligence Sharing:**
- 100% confirmed between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian intelligence base inside Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- State actors and terrorists meeting regularly
- Real-time operational coordination

**4. Supply Chains:**
- Russian channels moving supplies into U.S. for homeland attack
- Chinese uranium mine access for dirty bomb development
- Turkish transit routes for terrorists and weapons
- State-level logistics supporting terrorist operations

**5. Operational Coordination:**
- October 7th planned jointly by Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Iran, with Russian approval
- U.S. homeland attack supported by Russia, Iran, China
- Kandahar serves as coordination hub for multiple state actors
- Unprecedented level of international cooperation

### Strategic Implications for U.S. Policy

**1. Attribution Problem:**
- Attacks will be blamed on ISIS
- U.S. intelligence will support ISIS attribution (pre-planted intel)
- Real orchestrators (Al-Qaeda + state actors) will remain hidden
- Response will target wrong groups

**2. Safe Haven Cannot Be Addressed:**
- Primary safe haven is Afghanistan (no U.S. presence)
- Secondary safe havens in Iran, Pakistan
- Multiple state actors protecting terrorists
- No military solution without engaging multiple states

**3. Funding Contradiction:**
- U.S. funding same groups planning U.S. homeland attacks
- Congressional inaction despite 382,000 petition signatures
- Both parties complicit in continued funding
- No accountability mechanisms functioning

**4. Intelligence Failure:**
- 99% of intelligence collection lost in Afghanistan
- CIA suppressing information (Hamza alive)
- Foreign intelligence agencies know more than U.S.
- Governors receive zero threat reporting from federal government

**5. Near-Peer Competition:**
- All adversaries using terrorists as proxies
- U.S. attempting same (using Haqqani against Russia)
- Everyone thinks they're manipulating terrorists
- Terrorists playing all sides, benefiting from all

### The Islamic Army - Game Changer

**Why It Matters:**
- Unifies Sunni and Shia groups (breaks historical sectarian divide)
- State-level resources + terrorist motivation
- Operational flexibility and attribution confusion
- Fulfills Osama bin Laden's vision with Hamza's aggressive timeline
- 120,000 trained fighters under unified command
- Multiple simultaneous operations across theaters

### Upcoming Threats

**2025 Predictions (Adams):**
> "I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both."

**U.S. Homeland:**
- 1,000+ trained attackers deployed
- Mix of Al-Qaeda and ISIS (Islamic Army)
- Will be blamed on ISIS
- October 7th/Mumbai-style swarming attacks
- Multiple cities simultaneously
- Fedayeen fighters (fight to death)
- Suicide bombers with invisible vests
- Russian supply chain support
- Iranian intelligence/coordination

**Europe:**
- Separate 1,000 trained attackers
- Coordinated with U.S. attacks (timing unclear)
- Same state actor support

**Embassies:**
- U.S. Embassy Baghdad mentioned specifically
- Multiple African embassies threatened
- Middle East embassies
- Designed to push U.S. out of regions

### What Should Be Done (Not Currently Happening)

**1. Stop Taliban Funding:**
- Immediate cessation of weekly cash deliveries
- End Qatar political office funding
- End refugee program fraud
- Designate Taliban as terrorist organization

**2. Intelligence Collection:**
- Rebuild networks in Afghanistan (nearly impossible given betrayal)
- Admit loss of capability
- Invest in new sources
- Stop suppressing intelligence (Hamza alive)
- Share threat information with states/law enforcement

**3. State Actor Accountability:**
- Acknowledge Iran's role in October 7th and planned attacks
- Acknowledge Russia's supply chain support
- Acknowledge China's resource provision for dirty bombs
- Address safe havens in Pakistan

**4. Prepare First Responders:**
- Train for fedayeen fighters (new to U.S.)
- Train for suicide bombers (not experienced in U.S.)
- Train for Mumbai-style swarming attacks
- Federal government provide threat reporting to states
- State-level response capabilities (Florida model)

**5. Border Security:**
- Close southern border to illegal crossing
- Require visas from source countries (Ecuador allowing Chinese visa-free entry)
- Address Darien Gap choke point
- Screen for fake documents
- Pressure South American countries

### The Larger Strategic Picture

**Power Shift:**
> "Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are power players. People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country by our enemies. They're treating them with respect."

**Near-Peer Game:**
- Everyone playing terrorists as proxies
- Russia using against U.S. (Ukraine war)
- China positioning for future (long game)
- Iran deeply embedded (decades of relationship)
- North Korea participating (anti-U.S. coalition)
- U.S. attempting same (doomed to fail, helping enemies)

**Terrorists Winning:**
- Safe havens (Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan)
- State-level resources (multiple sponsors)
- No effective opposition (U.S. funding them)
- No accountability (Congressional inaction)
- Free to plan and train (30 camps in Afghanistan)
- 120,000 fighters trained (Islamic Army)
- International coordination (Kandahar hub)
- U.S. unprepared (governors receive no threat information)

### Adams' Final Assessment

**On Congressional Inaction:**
> "We're GWOT generation, have people from our generation in Congress. Going to show up to work tomorrow and be fine that this money going to Taliban. What the hell are they doing? Do your damn jobs. Do the right thing. You're an American, stand up for American ideals."

**On Intelligence Community:**
> "I don't know how we can't get smart people to be honest and say yeah we don't have this collection. I don't have an asset on Hamza bin Laden. I need to go make an asset on Hamza bin Laden. I'm behind the curve. Why can't they do that? Why aren't they doing their jobs?"

**On Upcoming Attacks:**
> "I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake."

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the propaganda and information warfare operations conducted by Al-Qaeda, Taliban, and allied terrorist networks, with particular emphasis on

 their preparation of a "U.S. funded its own attack" narrative for post-attack attribution confusion. The research reveals that terrorists are studying U.S. conspiracy theories (particularly about Building Seven from 9/11), preparing messaging that will exploit American political divisions, and developing sophisticated narratives to deflect blame while maximizing psychological impact.

**Key Findings:**
- Al-Qaeda researching U.S. conspiracy theories for post-attack narrative
- "Building Seven" fascination as template for future confusion
- Plan to attribute attacks to ISIS while Al-Qaeda escapes blame
- "U.S. funded its own attack" narrative being prepared (factually accurate given $44-87M weekly payments to Taliban/Al-Qaeda)
- Exploitation of U.S. political divisions in messaging
- Social media recruitment targeting disillusioned Americans
- Sophisticated understanding of U.S. information environment

## The "U.S. Funded Its Own Attack" Narrative

### The Setup

**Sarah Adams' Warning:**
> "Al-Qaeda makes jokes about U.S. funding going to camps training homeland attackers. Insider joke: 'America is funding its own attack.'"

**The Factual Foundation:**

This isn't a conspiracy theory - it's documented fact:
- **$44-87 million weekly** U.S. cash payments to Taliban/Al-Qaeda
- Payments go to eight stops, seven are designated terrorists
- Al-Qaeda Military Commission receiving direct payments
- Bin Laden brothers (Hamza, Saad, Abdullah) on payment list
- Khalil Haqqani refugee program: **$5 million monthly** to Al-Qaeda training camps
- Total: **$2.3-4.5 billion annually** to organizations training attackers

### Post-Attack Messaging Plan

**When Attack Occurs:**

**Phase 1: Immediate Aftermath**
- ISIS will be blamed (by design)
- Al-Qaeda stays quiet initially
- Confusion about who actually did it
- Multiple groups may claim credit

**Phase 2: Conspiracy Narrative Launch**
- Social media accounts activated
- "Research" released showing U.S. funding
- Congressional payment records cited
- $44-87 million weekly transfers documented
- Swiss bank account ($3.5 billion) revealed
- Refugee program fraud exposed

**Phase 3: Amplification**
- American conspiracy theorists latch onto narrative
- "Inside job" theories proliferate
- Political divisions exploited
- "Government funded terrorists who attacked us"
- Focus shifts from terrorists to U.S. government

**The Genius:**
It's true. The U.S. government *has* been funding the organization that trained the attackers. Al-Qaeda will simply reveal what the U.S. government tried to hide.

### Target Messages

**To American Left:**
- "Your tax dollars funded this"
- "Military-industrial complex created the threat"
- "Endless war profiteering"
- "Government lies again"

**To American Right:**
- "Deep state funded terrorists"
- "Biden administration gave them billions"
- "Afghanistan withdrawal armed them"
- "Swamp betrayed America"

**To Everyone:**
- "U.S. government funded its own attack"
- "Just like they claim about 9/11"
- "Follow the money"
- "Congressional records prove it"

### The Devastating Effectiveness

**Why It Will Work:**

1. **It's True** - Unlike most conspiracy theories, the funding is documented
2. **Bipartisan Appeal** - Both sides can use it
3. **Diverts Attention** - Focus on U.S. government, not terrorists
4. **Paralyzes Response** - Political infighting prevents unified action
5. **Demoralizes** - "Our own government did this"
6. **International Impact** - U.S. allies question American competence

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
> "They're going to say 'the U.S. funded this attack' and they'll be able to prove it because the U.S. actually did fund it. Not intentionally, but the money trail is real."

### Documentation They'll Use

**Congressional Records:**
- Weekly flight manifests (if obtained)
- Appropriations bills
- State Department cables
- Treasury reports

**Public Information:**
- Media reports on Taliban funding
- Congressional testimony (Sarah Adams, others)
- Petition signatures (382,000+)
- Failed legislation (Burchett bill, Mace bill)

**Afghan Sources:**
- Taliban will release their accounting
- Payment receipts
- Lists of recipients
- Photos of cash deliveries

### Counter-Narrative Problem

**U.S. Government Will Claim:**
- "Humanitarian aid"
- "Not intended for terrorists"
- "Diverted by Taliban"
- "We tried to prevent it"

**Terrorist Response:**
- "Direct payments, not diverted"
- "Eight specific recipients"
- "Bin Laden brothers on list"
- "Military Commission, not humanitarian"
- "Continued after knowing who received it"

**Result:**
U.S. denials sound like lies because the underlying facts support terrorist narrative.

## Building Seven Fascination

### What Is Building Seven?

**World Trade Center Building 7:**
- 47-story building adjacent to Twin Towers
- Collapsed on 9/11 despite not being hit by plane
- Official explanation: Fire damage and debris
- Source of persistent conspiracy theories

### Why Terrorists Are Fascinated

**The Lesson They Learned:**

**Not about whether conspiracy is true** - about its effectiveness:
1. **Creates Long-Term Doubt** - 23 years later, still debated
2. **Divides Americans** - "Truthers" vs. "Official Story"
3. **Distracts from Terrorists** - Focus on U.S. government instead
4. **No Resolution** - Argument never ends
5. **Self-Perpetuating** - Each side reinforces other's certainty

**Al-Qaeda's Takeaway:**
> "Confusion is as valuable as casualties"

### Application to Future Attacks

**The Template:**

**Create Multiple Anomalies:**
- Conflicting claims of responsibility
- Evidence pointing different directions
- Timing that seems suspicious
- Government response that raises questions
- "Convenient" political outcomes

**Example Planning:**
- Attack occurs during specific political moment
- Evidence suggests both ISIS and Al-Qaeda
- Anonymous "whistleblower" releases "inside" info
- Government statements contradict each other
- Physical evidence disappears or is disputed

**Goal:**
Create permanent debate about who really did it and why, dividing Americans and paralyzing response.

### "Research" on Building Seven

**What Terrorists Study:**

**Truthers' Arguments:**
- Structural analysis
- Timeline questions
- Demolition theories
- Government investigation criticism
- Missing evidence claims

**Why These Work:**
- Technical enough to sound credible
- Complex enough to be confusing
- Passionate advocates amplify
- Never definitively settled
- Government denials sound defensive

**Application:**
Future attacks will include elements designed to spark similar debates:
- Structural issues that seem impossible
- Timeline gaps that raise questions
- Evidence that disappears
- Government explanations that don't satisfy

### The Inside Joke

**Among Terrorists:**
> "Americans will blame their own government before they blame us"

**The Strategy:**
Let conspiracy theorists do the work:
- Terrorists conduct attack
- Leave confusing evidence
- Americans create elaborate theories
- Theories blame U.S. government
- Terrorists escape blame and retaliate freely

---

## Attribution Strategy - Blame ISIS

### The Plan

**Post-Attack Attribution:**

**Step 1: ISIS Takes Credit**
- ISIS-K or other ISIS branch claims responsibility
- Some evidence points to ISIS
- Media reports "ISIS attack"
- Public focuses on ISIS

**Step 2: Al-Qaeda Stays Silent**
- No Al-Qaeda claim
- No obvious Al-Qaeda signature
- Intelligence "confirms" ISIS
- Al-Qaeda operatives blend into ISIS narrative

**Step 3: Confusion Grows**
- Some evidence doesn't fit ISIS profile
- Intelligence leaks suggest Al-Qaeda involvement
- Public confused about who really did it
- Debate begins

**Step 4: Attribution Becomes Political**
- Democrats blame ISIS
- Republicans blame Al-Qaeda
- Media confused
- Intelligence community divided or suppressed
- Truth lost in politics

### Why ISIS Attribution

**Advantages for Al-Qaeda:**

1. **ISIS Already Perceived as Top Threat**
   - U.S. government narrative emphasizes ISIS-K
   - Public primed to believe ISIS responsible
   - "Expected" threat

2. **ISIS Has Claimed False Attacks Before**
   - History of exaggerated claims
   - Makes plausible they'd claim Al-Qaeda attack
   - Provides cover

3. **Haqqani Network Controls ISIS-K**
   - Sirajuddin Haqqani installed Sanullah Ghafari as ISIS-K leader
   - ISIS-K follows Haqqani/Taliban/Al-Qaeda direction
   - Can order ISIS to claim attack
   - "Two separate organizations" but actually coordinated

4. **Protects Al-Qaeda for Future Operations**
   - If ISIS blamed, Al-Qaeda free to plan next attack
   - Resources not targeted at Al-Qaeda
   - Allows continued operations
   - No pressure on Al-Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan

5. **U.S. Government Will Accept ISIS Attribution**
   - Fits their narrative (ISIS threat, not Al-Qaeda)
   - Allows them to avoid admitting Al-Qaeda return
   - Prevents questions about funding
   - "We told you ISIS-K was the threat"

### Sarah Adams' Warning

**The Reality:**
> "U.S. government is saying ISIS is a bigger threat than Al-Qaeda. That's super frustrating because it's actually not a fact. Al-Qaeda is the bigger threat in Afghanistan than ISIS. But the US government is saying ISIS is a bigger threat than al-Qaeda."

**Why Government Promotes ISIS Narrative:**
- Makes Taliban appear as counterterrorism partner
- Taliban "fighting ISIS-K"
- Justifies continued payments
- Obscures Al-Qaeda presence and cooperation

**Post-Attack:**
- Government will jump on ISIS attribution
- Confirms their narrative
- Avoids admitting they were wrong
- Prevents accountability for funding

### The Islamic Army Reality

**What Media Won't Report:**

**All One Organization:**
- Al-Qaeda + Taliban + ISIS-K + Hamas + Hezbollah
- Unified under "Islamic Army" command
- Hamza bin Laden (Supreme Commander)
- Hamza al-Ghamdi (Military Commander)
- 120,000 trained fighters

**Attribution Meaningless:**
- Doesn't matter which "brand" claims it
- All same organization
- All same training
- All same funding
- All same leadership

**But Public Won't Know:**
- Media reports as separate groups
- Intelligence community suppresses Islamic Army intel
- Government maintains fiction of separation
- Allows shell game with attribution

## Exploiting Political Divisions

### Understanding the Divide

**What Terrorists See:**

**American Left:**
- Distrusts military and intelligence
- Skeptical of national security state
- Anti-war sentiment
- Believes government lies to justify wars
- Sympathetic to "root causes" of terrorism

**American Right:**
- Distrusts government bureaucracy
- Skeptical of deep state
- Pro-military but anti-corruption
- Believes government incompetent or malicious
- Focused on border security

**Both Sides:**
- Don't trust establishment
- Believe media lies
- Think other side is threat to country
- Will believe worst about opponents

### Messaging by Audience

**To American Left:**

**Pre-Attack:**
- U.S. imperialism creates terrorism
- Military-industrial complex profits from fear
- Refugees fleeing American wars
- Government lies to justify spending

**Post-Attack:**
- "Your tax dollars funded this"
- Military-industrial complex created threat
- Endless war leads to blowback
- Government sacrificed Americans for profit
- Afghanistan withdrawal was right - staying caused this

**To American Right:**

**Pre-Attack:**
- Weak borders allow terrorists in
- Liberal policies endanger America
- Deep state incompetent
- Government knows but won't act
- Elites protected, regular Americans vulnerable

**Post-Attack:**
- "Open borders" caused this
- Deep state funded terrorists
- Liberal policies killed Americans
- Government betrayed country
- Swamp put Americans in danger for globalist agenda

**Result:**
- Left blames right-wing militarism
- Right blames left-wing weakness
- Americans fight each other
- Terrorists plan next attack

### Specific Wedge Issues

**Issue 1: Afghanistan Withdrawal**

**Left Narrative:**
- Withdrawal correct decision
- Can't stay forever
- Republican wars caused this
- Should have left sooner

**Right Narrative:**
- Withdrawal was surrender
- Biden's incompetence armed terrorists
- Should have stayed
- Leaving caused instability that led to attack

**Terrorist Exploitation:**
- Claim both are partially right
- U.S. shouldn't have been there AND withdrawal was disaster
- Use each side's arguments against the other
- Prevent unified understanding

**Issue 2: Border Security**

**Left Narrative:**
- Refugees are victims
- Security theater doesn't work
- Xenophobia endangers Americans
- Real threat is domestic extremism

**Right Narrative:**
- Open borders allowed terrorists in
- Warnings ignored
- Political correctness prevented security
- Obvious threat denied

**Terrorist Exploitation:**
- Some attackers will have crossed border illegally
- Some will have legal visas
- Ensures both sides have evidence for their narrative
- Prevents productive policy response

**Issue 3: Government Funding**

**Left Narrative:**
- Military-industrial complex diverted money from social programs
- Contractors profited from endless war
- Government corruption enabled this
- Corporate interests drove policy

**Right Narrative:**
- Deep state funded Taliban
- Billions to terrorists while Americans suffered
- Corruption at highest levels
- Globalist agenda sacrificed America

**Terrorist Exploitation:**
- Both narratives supported by facts (U.S. did fund Taliban)
- Use truth of funding to validate other claims
- Make Americans focus on government, not terrorists

## Conclusion

Terrorist propaganda operations have evolved to exploit U.S. political divisions, conspiracy theories, and institutional distrust. The most devastating narrative—that the U.S. government funded the terrorists who will attack—is actually true, making counter-narratives extremely difficult.

The fascination with Building Seven from 9/11 shows that terrorists understand confusion is as valuable as casualties. By designing attacks to maximize uncertainty and political division, they can accomplish strategic goals even beyond the immediate violence.

The plan to attribute attacks to ISIS while protecting Al-Qaeda leadership demonstrates sophisticated understanding of U.S. government narratives and willingness to exploit them. The fact that Haqqani Network controls ISIS-K makes this attribution deception operationally feasible.

**Key Vulnerabilities:**
- U.S. government credibility at historic low
- Political divisions deeper than any time since Civil War
- Public won't trust official post-attack narrative
- Funding of Taliban/Al-Qaeda provides factual basis for conspiracy
- Media and expert credibility compromised
- Social media allows rapid spread of misinformation

**Urgent Actions:**
- Stop funding Taliban/Al-Qaeda immediately
- Transparent accounting prevents "funded own attack" narrative
- Build bipartisan unity before attack
- Prepare social media response
- Educate public on expected propaganda

**The Race:**
Time is running out. With 1,000+ trained terrorists deployed for 2025 attacks, propaganda infrastructure is already in place. The narratives are ready. The accounts are positioned. The messaging will deploy instantly upon attack.

The only question is whether the United States will take action to prevent the attack and preempt the propaganda, or whether Americans will tear themselves apart arguing about who funded the terrorists who killed them.

Tragically, the answer to "who funded them" is already clear: We did.

### October 7th Hamas Attacks - Planning

**Timeline:**
- **March 2022:** Planning began (after Russia invaded Ukraine)
- Terrorists believed world focus on Ukraine created opportunity
- Russia encouraged attack
- **Original Date:** October 7, 2022
- **Significance:** Anniversary of Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- October 7, 2001: George Bush announced operation, began carpet bombing Kandahar
- **This connects October 7th directly to Afghanistan**

**Delay:**
- July 31, 2022: U.S. drone strike killed Zawahiri in Kabul
- Al-Qaeda feared U.S. would bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Russia wanted 2022 attack to relieve Ukraine war pressure
- Al-Qaeda delayed to 2023
- Attack delayed exactly one year
- Additional training time beneficial

**Training:**
- **August 7, 2022:** Training began

### U.S. Homeland Attack Planning

**Confirmed Intelligence:**
- 1,000 trained terrorists deployed for U.S. homeland attack
- Adams believes actual number may be higher
- All training completed
- Attackers deployed
- Planned execution: 2025

**Training Types:**
1. Advanced urban warfare
2. Suicide bombing (invisible bomb vest technology)
3. Cover and covert operations (extreme OpSec)

**Entry Methods:**
1. **Southern Border:** Through Darien Gap, fake documents
2. **Legal Immigration:** Saudi, Kuwaiti, Jordanian "clean" terrorists with tourist visas

**Attack Template: Mumbai Model**
1. Swarming attacks (multiple targets simultaneously)
2. Operational flexibility (real-time target changes)
3. Real-time intelligence (command center feeding info)
4. Extended duration (not hit-and-run)

**Fedayeen Fighters:**
- Fight to the death
- Will not surrender
- May appear to surrender but detonate vest
- U.S. first responders not trained for this
- "We haven't had fedayeen attackers" in United States

**Mixed Force:**
- Mix of Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters
- ISIS fighters deliberately included
- Purpose: ISIS will claim responsibility
- More fighters: ISIS (if caught, directs attention from Al-Qaeda)
- More suicide bombers: Al-Qaeda (can't be interrogated after detonation)

**Target Selection:**
- Al-Qaeda: Symbolic (U.S. Capitol), economic (bridges, metro), mass casualty
- ISIS: Just mass casualty, softer targets
- Tactical flexibility: Real-time target changes authorized

**Intelligence Pre-Planting:**
- Taliban feeding info on ISIS-K terrorists to U.S. for years
- Creating paper trail in databases
- After attack: U.S. will find prior intel, confirm "ISIS"
- Won't recognize Al-Qaeda, Taliban, or state actor involvement

**State Actor Support:**
- Russian pipelines helping bring supplies into U.S.
- Iranian intelligence and planning support
- Chinese resources/access in Afghanistan

**Adams' Warning:**
"I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both."

**Casualty Estimates:**
- Scott Mann reportedly told Shawn Ryan: Al-Qaeda predicting 50,000-60,000 American deaths
- (Adams did not confirm specific number but confirmed scale)

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND CRITICAL ISSUES

### Immediate Actions Needed

**1. Stop Taliban Funding**
- Weekly $44-87 million deliveries
- All going to designated terrorists

- Funding those holding American hostages

**2. Designate Terrorists**
- Abdullah Bin Laden (only top 3 Al-Qaeda not designated)
- Mohammad Kazemi (IRGC, not on FBI Most Wanted)
- Taliban as terrorist organization (currently blocked)

**3. State-Level Response**
- Florida model: State National Guard CT capability
- Brief all law enforcement
- Establish information sharing
- Specialized training (fedayeen, suicide bombers, Mumbai-style)

**4. Intelligence Collection Changes**
- Stop compartmentalizing terrorist groups
- Cross-functional collection
- Track resource sharing, joint training, coordination
- Recognize second-generation terrorists

**5. Border Security**
- Close southern border
- Pressure South American countries on visa policies
- Address pipeline further south
- Verify documents and nationalities

**6. Afghan Ally Protection**
- Warn about biometric system now operational
- Evacuation of at-risk allies
- Accountability for leaving systems behind

**7. Benghazi Justice**
- Stop retry of fake mastermind (Abu Khattala)
- Go after actual mortar team
- Deport FBI witness to face trial in Libya
- Target Musa (document forger) as top priority

**8. Federal Information Sharing**
- Threat reporting to states
- Information to law enforcement
- Training recommendations
- Preparation guidance

## INTELLIGENCE GAPS AND FAILURES

### Major U.S. Government Failures

**1. Hamza bin Laden**
- Officially dead since 2019, actually alive
- CIA suppressing information
- Peace deal was with Bin Laden family
- Leading all current operations

**2. Mohammad Kazemi**
- Mastermind of October 7th
- Mastermind of Trump assassination plot
- $145 million/month budget
- Not on FBI Most Wanted List

**3. Abbey Gate**
- 3.5 years, never found bomber's true name
- Adams found in 4 months
- 12 terrorists identified
- Haqqani Network role concealed

**4. October 7th Warning**
- Information provided to Israel ignored
- Hamas training in Afghanistan observed
- Same intel passed to U.S., not acted upon
- "Making same mistake"

**5. Taliban Funding**
- Weekly payments to designated terrorists
- Congress aware, no action
- 382,000 signatures, zero response
- Bills introduced, dead or stalled

**6. Zawahiri Status**
- Reported dead July 2022
- Over 2 years later: Not eulogized by Al-Qaeda
- Al-Qaeda never fakes eulogies
- May still be alive

**7. Information Sharing**
- Zero threat reporting to states (per DeSantis)
- No information to local law enforcement
- No training occurring
- "Most of country never heard Al-Qaeda planning attack"

**8. Biometric Systems**
- Left complete database in Taliban hands
- Chinese and Iranians got it working
- 10,000+ Afghan allies killed using it
- 30,000 captured
- 12,000 missing

---

## CONCLUSION

This report identifies over 100 individuals with confirmed terrorist connections, operational roles, and direct threats to United States interests. Key findings include:

**Active Threats:**
- 1,000 trained terrorists deployed for U.S. homeland attack (2025)
- 1,000 deployed for European attacks
- Multiple embassy attacks planned
- Trump assassination plot with $145 million monthly budget

**Government Failures:**
- U.S. funding designated terrorists weekly ($44-87 million)
- Senior Al-Qaeda leaders receiving U.S. cash
- Three Americans held hostage by organization receiving U.S. funds
- Multiple individuals officially reported dead are alive and operational
- Zero threat information shared with state/local law enforcement

**Intelligence Gaps:**
- Hamza bin Laden alive and leading operations (U.S. claims dead)
- Mohammad Kazemi not on FBI Most Wanted despite two major plots
- Second-generation terrorists completely ignored
- Cross-organizational terrorism not tracked
- October 7th-style intelligence warnings being ignored for U.S.

**Systemic Issues:**
- Peace deal was actually with Bin Laden family (married into Taliban)
- CIA suppressing information about terrorist leaders being alive
- Pentagon prioritizing bureaucracy over personnel safety
- Congress refusing to designate Taliban as terrorists
- FBI witness who is war criminal living in Virginia

**Urgent Action Required:**
- Stop all Taliban funding immediately
- Designate remaining terrorists (Abdullah Bin Laden, Mohammad Kazemi)
- State-level counterterrorism capability (Florida model)
- Prepare law enforcement for fedayeen fighters, suicide bombers, Mumbai-style attacks
- Protect Afghan allies from biometric targeting
- Secure southern border from terrorist infiltration

The persons identified in this report represent clear and present dangers to U.S. national security, with multiple active plots, extensive terrorist networks, and state-level support from Iran, Russia, and China. Immediate action is required to prevent catastrophic attacks on U.S. soil and against U.S. interests globally.

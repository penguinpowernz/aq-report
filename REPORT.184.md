## The Syrian Conflict

### The Syrian Blitzkrieg Plan

**Timeline - November 2021:**
Planning began for Syrian takeover immediately following Afghanistan's fall to Taliban

**Key Planners:**
1. **Musa bin Ali** (Benghazi plotter, Al-Qaeda operative)
2. **Abu Muhammad Al-Julani** (current president of Syria)

- Julani took over Syria

**Current Status:**
Musa bin Ali runs a large terrorist training camp in Libya south of Misrata with Julani

### U.S. and International Response

**Media and Diplomatic Narrative:**
- Press, American diplomats, EU, and UN all claimed this was "bringing democracy to Syria"
- Language: "Inclusive government" (same language used for Afghanistan)
- Reality: Plan is to make Syria an Islamic caliphate like Afghanistan

**U.S. Government Actions:**
- State Department removed $10 million bounty on Julani
- Rewards for Justice website page on Julani disappeared "in a matter of minutes"
- "He was a terrorist on Monday evening, he was no longer a terrorist"
- U.S. Department of Defense has been taking out Julani's rivals for the last month
- U.S. consolidating power for the terrorist

**Julani's Background:**
- Member of ISIS
- Former terrorist
- "Once a Jihadi you're always a Jihadi - you don't change overnight"
- Now wears suit and tie instead of turban
- U.S. state department has official relationship with him
- They share intelligence with him

### Plan for Syria

**Ethnic Cleansing:**
- Christians
- Alawites
- Kurds
- "Any minority"
- Goal: Islamic caliphate (Sharia law)
- Same model as Afghanistan Taliban

**The Caliphate Plan:**
Led by Hamza Bin Laden (Osama's son, honoring his father's vision)

**Countries in the Caliphate (Current and Planned):**
1. **Iran** - Already considered part (long established)
2. **Afghanistan** - First in current generation
3. **Syria** - Second (just fell)
4. **Next targets:** Somalia or Mali (debating which is first)
5. **Future targets:** Iraq, Burkina Faso, Libya

**Strategy:**
- Drop countries to terrorists
- Become pieces of caliphate
- Connect over time
- Create "giant Islamic emirate"

---

## Taliban and Al-Qaeda Connection to Syria

### Taliban Fighters in Syria

**Current Presence:**
- Taliban fighters are in Syria right now
- Taliban members supported Julani during takeover
- Taliban provided training, fighters, and planning support

**Historical Context:**
- November 2021 planning meeting in Afghanistan
- Training camps provided in Nangarhar Province
- 10,000 Al-Qaeda trained fighters sent to Syria
- Joint Taliban/Al-Qaeda/Julani operation

**Musa bin Ali's Role:**

- Runs large terrorist camp in Libya south of Misrata
- Key connector between Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan operations
- "Number one target" of Benghazi investigation (Sarah Adams)

### Al-Qaeda's Central Role

- Hamza Bin Laden committed to training fighters
- 10,000 fighters trained specifically for Syrian operation
- Training occurred in Afghanistan over 2-3 years
- On top of Julani's own training operations

**Operational Planning:**
- Al-Qaeda planned the Syrian Blitzkrieg
- Same terrorist networks involved in Benghazi, Afghanistan, now Syria
- Musa bin Ali (Benghazi) connecting all operations

- Hamza: "I'm going to do it in my lifetime to honor my father"

### U.S. Withdrawal from Syria

**Current Status:**
U.S. is leaving Syria

**ISIS Camps:**

---

## Christian Persecution in Syria

### Scale of Killings

**Reported Numbers:**
- "In the thousands"
- Exact numbers very limited due to terrorist-run government
- Only seeing "maybe 10% of the numbers"
- Most deaths unreported

**Comparison to Syrian Civil War:**
- Over 500,000 Syrians died during civil war under Assad
- U.S. and press ignored those deaths
- Now acting concerned when terrorist doing the killings
- "These atrocities have been going on for a long time in Syria"

### Methods of Execution

**ISIS-Style Killings:**
- Beheadings
- Executions
- Bodies dumped in rivers
- Children put in cages and drowned in river
- Women taken as sex slaves
- "Unimaginable level of horror"

**Burning Alive:**
- Putting people in cages
- Setting them on fire
- Same methods ISIS used in Iraq against Christians

**Systematic Targeting:**
- Going through demographic group by group
- Alawite neighborhoods hit
- Christian communities targeted
- Kurds being attacked

### Disarmament Trap

**Registration Scheme:**
- Julani required weapons be turned in
- Required registration
- "Be part of this new democracy, this inclusive government"

**Results:**
- Christians and Alawites turned in weapons
- West was pushing this narrative
- Think tanks in US urged Kurds to turn in weapons

**Kurdish Response:**
- Kurds refused to turn in weapons
- Still armed and defending themselves
- Still being attacked by Turkish government
- But not defenseless like other groups

**War Predicted:**
- "Going to end up being some sort of larger war"
- Kurds will not give weapons to terrorists
- Still have capability to resist

### Taliban Members Leading Killings

**Legend's Intelligence:**
"There are Taliban fighters in Syria, there are Taliban members that supported Julani during his takeover of Syria just a few months ago and there are Taliban fighters in Syria right now currently at the moment"

**Religious Minorities Targeted:**
- Christians being slaughtered daily
- Alawites (another minority in country)
- Not just Christians - many Muslims being killed too
- Any group not supporting jihadi vision

---

## European Immigration and Security Concerns

### Current Immigration Crisis

**Open Border Policy:**
- Europe has open borders
- Allow everyone and anyone in
- Don't vet immigrants
- Results: stabbings, attacks, violence

**Recent Example:**
- Afghan immigrant stabbed 4-year-old child and parent
- When arrested, was laughing
- "You will see that laughter in America here in our own community unless that border is closed"

**Legend's Warning:**
"Unless the southern border is closed and unless you start vetting and unless you start paying attention to who you are allowing into this country"

### Nuclear Powers at Risk

**Strategic Concern:**
- European countries are nuclear powers
- Immigration changing demographics
- What happens when governments overturn?
- UK, France, others could fall to Islamic extremists
- "What happens when UK gets overturned and it is all Islamic extremist?"

**Shawn's Question:**
"When the UK government gets overturned and it is all Islamic extremists...these are nuclear powers"

### Root Causes - Corruption and Influence

**Sarah Adams Analysis:**

**Three Main Actors:**

1. **Muslim Brotherhood**
   - Banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE
   - NOT banned in America
   - Makes so much money lobbying
   - Brings money to Democratic Party
   - Influencing U.S. justice system
   - Funding terrorist family court cases in U.S.
   - Example: Three brothers (one surgeon in Virginia running Libyan-American organizations with State Department relationships as Muslim Brotherhood cover; one Libyan Ambassador; one Al-Qaeda facilitator in Europe bringing injured fighters from Turkey to Bosnia)

2. **Qatar**
   - Huge influence on universities
   - Played out with support of Hamas
   - Has influence in Europe
   - Provides money to politicians
   - Makes those political shifts

3. **Turkey**
   - Can't seem to choose sides
   - Enables different terrorist groups, especially ISIS
   - Allows terrorists to flow through borders
   - Provides passports to terrorists
   - Member of NATO despite these actions
   - Has big play in Syria

**The Problem:**
"If you don't deal with the Muslim Brotherhood, ban them, the influence of Qatar, and then allow Turkey to stay in NATO with their actions...that's the problem right...they're the ones causing the influence putting the money into politics and making those shifts"

### Switzerland - Terrorism Hub

**Key Facts:**
- Switzerland is number one country in Europe with terrorists
- Especially high-level terrorists
- Because of Muslim Brotherhood influence
- Qatar has lot of influence and money in Europe
- Corruption enables terrorist presence

## Afghanistan Intelligence Updates

### Loss of Human Intelligence

**Scott Mann's Assessment:**
"98 to 99% of the human intelligence assets in Afghanistan that took 20 years to build were left behind"
- Quote from former CENTCOM Commander
- Complete abandonment of intelligence network
- Veterans filled the gap

**What Happened:**
- August 15, 2021: U.S. abandoned intelligence assets
- No formal intelligence agency picked up these relationships
- Veterans maintained contacts for "primarily humanitarian reasons"
- Four years later: "High veracity intelligence and reporting coming through these channels instead of formal channels"

### The Veteran Network

**How It Works:**
- Veterans with pre-existing relationships found ways to do humanitarian outreach
- Filled gap when no one else picking up phone
- Cultivated relationships as intelligence guys
- Multiple veterans doing their "version of that" at scale

**Examples:**
- Legend maintaining relationship with President Amrullah Saleh
- Sarah Adams maintaining Libya contacts and Benghazi investigation
- Scott Mann with Afghan Special Forces and Commandos

**Result:**
"Literally the guy who was regarded as the father of Afghanistan intelligence talking primarily to an Afghan American Army US Army NCO"

### Current Intelligence Sources

**Where U.S. Gets Intelligence Now:**
- From the Taliban
- From Sirajuddin Haqqani
- From the GDI (Taliban intelligence service)
- NOT from resistance forces
- NOT from former allies

**The Problem:**
"We lost 98 to 99% of our collection and our assets we developed over 20 years, we're now bringing in reporting but it's from the Taliban"

---

## President Amrullah Saleh and Afghanistan Green Trend

### President Saleh's Background

**Career History:**
- Age 15-16: Started in resistance
- Did liaison intelligence work under Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud
- Fought against Soviet invasion
- Fought Taliban and Al-Qaeda
- Post-2001: Became head of NDS (National Directorate of Security)
  - Afghan version of Central Intelligence Agency
  - America helped build NDS
  - Saleh literally built that unit
- Minister of Interior of Afghanistan
- 2011: Started AGT (Afghanistan Green Trend)
  - One of main political parties in Afghanistan
  - Grassroots movement
  - Had millions of members inside Afghanistan
- 2019: Won elections, became First Vice President
  - Under President Ashraf Ghani
- August 15, 2021: Ghani fled to Dubai
  - Saleh did NOT flee
  - Went to Panjshir Valley (only province not fallen to Taliban)
  - Declared national resistance against Taliban
- According to Articles 60 and 67 of Constitution: Became Acting President
- July 2024: Time in office ended
- Currently: Leading intelligence in Afghanistan
  - "Spies never quit"
  - Runs intelligence network operational in Afghanistan

**Legend's Assessment:**
"I don't think there's any American intelligence official that is unfamiliar with Mr. Saleh. He was and he I believe he still is our ally"

### Afghanistan Green Trend (AGT)

**Organization:**
- Intelligence network operational in Afghanistan
- NOT the GDI (Taliban intelligence)
- Under control of the resistance
- Most active and reliable intelligence network
- By far most reliable intelligence Legend has seen

**Network Scale:**
- Saleh runs extensive sources in Afghanistan
- "I don't think anyone has as much sources under his control as Mr. Saleh in that region"

**Intelligence Provided:**
- Most reliable intelligence coming from AGT
- Document-based intelligence
- On-ground reporting
- Information on Taliban, Al-Qaeda, ISIS-K operations

### U.S. Abandonment of Saleh

**Scott Mann:**
"Mr. Saleh was abandoned just like a whole bunch of other Afghan assets were abandoned on August 15th"

**The Gap:**
- Formal intelligence agencies abandoned him
- Legend maintained the relationship
- "Over these last several years Legend has cultivated a relationship and really done the job...of what a formal intelligence agency would normally do with a massive asset like that"

**Current Reality:**
"You've got literally the guy who was regarded as the father of Afghanistan intelligence talking primarily to an Afghan American Army US Army NCO and that's where that primary relationship took place"

---

## Terrorist Operatives in the United States

### The 1,000+ Number

**Source of Intelligence:**
President Amrullah Saleh / Afghanistan Green Trend (AGT)

**Legend's Statement:**
"There are over 1,000 Taliban and ISIS-K operatives in the United States"

**Critical Distinction:**
"These 1,000 are not the individuals that were emboldened after the United States abandoned Afghanistan and withdrew. These are not the individuals in the Afghan-American community in the diaspora or those we brought in - 120,000 that were evacuated. They're not members of those communities who are now sympathetic towards the Taliban."

**Who They Are:**
"The 1,000 or so that I mentioned these are deep cover operatives that report to Sirajuddin Haqqani and then the leadership of the Taliban and ISIS-K"

### Taliban Fighters Going Back and Forth

**Legend's Intel:**
"There are Afghan Americans from California, from Tennessee, from Florida, from New Jersey, from New York that have went back and joined the Taliban that are serving with the Taliban right now and these folks go back and forth"

**Training Video Context:**
Discussion of Taliban training video showing advanced tactics

**Legend:**
"They were trained - most of them were trained by the US Special Operations community while we were there. Some were evacuated to the United States by the Biden Administration and then they decided to go back. They decided to go back and join the Taliban."

**The Process:**
- Trained by U.S. Special Operations
- Evacuated to United States
- Went back to Afghanistan
- Joined Taliban
- Get debriefed and rebriefed by Taliban/Haqqani
- Sent back to United States
- "Don't think that individual you see in the range is only in Afghanistan - they're going back and forth"

### Multiple Terrorist Organizations Represented

**Sarah Adams:**
"When he says there's a thousand just under the bucket of ISIS-K and the Haqqanis right, then we talk about all the groups Al-Qaeda is aligned with how many of those are in the country because Al-Qaeda is saying that's another thousand right"

**The Groups:**
1. Taliban operatives
2. ISIS-K operatives
3. Al-Qaeda operatives
4. Haqqani Network operatives
5. All aligned groups

**The Scale:**
"These numbers start to get really big when you bring all these groups under one umbrella to fight a common enemy: us"

### Why They're Here

**Purpose:**
"They want you to feel it in your neighborhood, at your home. They don't want you to feel safe where you live now"

**Motivation:**
"We impacted them in Afghanistan, we impacted them in Iraq, we impacted them in Syria which is kind of the most recent open wound right, and so they want our warfighters who did that in those countries to feel it here"

### The Homeland Plot

**Al-Qaeda Leadership:**
Sirajuddin Haqqani (Minister of Interior, Afghanistan) is central to the plot

**Hafiz Haqqani's Role:**
- Sirajuddin's cousin
- Runs refugee services in Afghanistan
- Involved in Abbey Gate attack
- Involved in U.S. homeland plot
- Takes humanitarian dollars and gives to foreign jihadists
- Claims they're "refugees coming back into the country"
- Pipeline of U.S. money going to foreign fighters

**Joint Training Camps:**
- Location where U.S. dropped "mother of all bombs"
- Named after Sirajuddin's father: Jalaladin Haqqani Training Center
- Has Al-Qaeda terrorists
- Has ISIS-K terrorists
- Has Haqqani Network terrorists
- All training together

**Sarah Adams:**
"When we talk about Al-Qaeda's homeland plot they're using the Haqqanis to leverage in the plot, they're using ISIS to leverage in the plot, and then of course Al-Qaeda's leading the plot"

### Why No Attacks Yet (Israel Comparison)

**Sarah Adams Analysis:**
"Israel had a little hubris right, there were reports going into Israel, Israel got information. I saw some of the stuff passed to Israel about the Hamas guys training in Afghanistan and they did have some belief something's going to happen, they never thought it was going to be the scale it was."

**Current U.S. Position:**
"Now the US government is getting the same type of information Israel is getting, probably a lot more, and they're now like 'oh that's not going to happen here at this at that level right, we're not going to see that happen here' and that's very very dangerous"

### Vetting Problem

**The Challenge:**
"How do you revet 14 million people?"

**Who Needs Vetting:**
1. Everybody who crossed border in last 4 years (14 million)
2. Everybody given passports and visas in last 4 years

**Sarah Adams:**
"We need to be running against this threat like this needs to be fast forward, the toughest thing we ever did. We need to basically take almost like it's a crisis right...we need to pull in I don't care if it's retired people, we need to put 10,000 people vetting all these"

**The Corroboration Problem:**
"They arrest an individual, say he's Afghan, and they suspect he's a terrorist. Who did they corroborate that information with? They call the Taliban and say hey do you know Mr Abdullah that is here? And if that person is one of those deep covered Taliban operatives or ISIS-K operatives, do you think the Taliban will admit to it? No, they'll say we have no record on him."

### State Department Visa Issuance

**Sarah Adams:**
"Our State Department has been issuing passports and visas to Haqqani Network guys. Plenty of former CIA officers have provided tips to the government over the last four years, they haven't picked them up. They live in our communities, they know Haqqani are here right, so that's not just the terrorists who came here under fake [identities] and are undercover right."

**The Scale:**
"To understand just how many are in our country is really scary"

---

## Taliban Sympathizers in U.S. Government

### Political Calculus to Avoid Resistance

**Scott Mann:**
"There was a political calculus to the when we left Afghanistan in 2021 and you saw it happen where the former Administration made a conscious decision to not engage members of the resistance"

**Overt Actions:**
- State Department blocked engagement with resistance
- Impeded outreach to resistance forces
- Essentially no contact with resistance
- Veterans were the only ones maintaining relationships

**The Gap:**
"High veracity assets that you would normally that we cultivated for 20 years, they were talking to veterans, they were talking to intelligence alone, not [official channels], and there was no formal relationship"

### Ambassador Karen Decker

**Position:**
- U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan
- Appointed by Joe Biden administration
- Still U.S. Ambassador under Trump administration

**Legend's Description:**
"Ambassador Karen Decker is literally acting as the unofficial first lady of the Taliban"

**Her Actions:**
1. Direct communication with every Taliban governor all over Afghanistan
2. Denounced armed resistance against Taliban, ISIS-K, and Al-Qaeda
3. Has not met with leadership of the resistance
4. Does not speak with the resistance
5. Denounced the resistance
6. Diplomatically dealing only with Taliban

**Blocking Resistance Events:**
"Whenever the resistance, the anti-Taliban resistance, hosts events - political diplomatic events, conferences - in order to unite the Afghan communities in this war against the Taliban, whenever they meet up in Vienna or Dushanbe or anywhere else, the State Department under the leadership of Ambassador Karen Decker dispatches individuals and says to the host countries to not allow it to happen"

**Pressure on Tajikistan:**
State Department went to Tajikistan government and intelligence leadership and said "don't have relationships with the resistance, it's going to affect your relationship with the US government"

### Thomas West

**Position:**
- Special Envoy to Afghanistan (moved to another role)
- Now in charge of sanctions at State Department

**His Views:**
"Ambassador Thomas West believes Taliban are professionals, sincere, and technocrats"

**The Problem:**
"We got now a Taliban sympathizer in charge of sanctions, so how often do you think she's sanctioning the Taliban?"

**His Quote (after Kabul fall):**
"We will do anything at all cost to recognize the Taliban"

**Sarah Adams:**
"This is the broker we have"

### Institutional Point of View

**Scott Mann Analysis:**
"There's an institutional point of view that started to form I don't know certainly when Afghanistan collapsed in 2021, this emerging point of view in our government from the previous administration that the Taliban are actually someone we could deal with, someone we could normalize relations with, someone who really offers a better solution not just in Afghanistan but global stability"

**Evidence of This View:**
- Humanitarian aid money going to Taliban
- Counterterrorism dollars going to Taliban
- Complete omission of engagement with Commandos and Special Forces
- "Not even tacit political support" for resistance

**Divergent Views:**
"That is such a divergent point of view from the veteran population who fought this war for 20 years and who has been on the phone nonstop"

### Who Has Taliban Sympathizers

**Sarah Adams:**
"We need to be honest, we have Taliban sympathizers in our government right. We have them in the State Department, we likely have them in the NSC, we definitely have them in the CIA right. This is a problem. Unless we root them out it's just like if when you had communists in the government which we still do right, when you have these influences in the government they're the ones making these deals, they're the ones making sure the money keeps going to the Taliban and to the terrorists."

**Why They Stay:**
"There's a lot of money involved in this, there's corruption involved in supporting terrorism as well"

---

## U.S. Funding of the Taliban

### Amount and Variation

**Public Statement:**
"$40 million a week"

**Actual Range:**
- Low end: $40 million per week
- High end: $87 million per week
- Third week of January 2025: $105 million that week
- "I even think saying 87's low at this point"

**Additional Funding:**
$10 million more per month to Taliban's office in Doha, Qatar

**Sarah Adams:**
"That doesn't count the money we also ship to Qatar because remember we also fund the Taliban's office in Doha...so even the money we talk about that comes on the airplane is not all of it and that's another thing our government needs to be honest about. There are a lot of pockets of money going to the Taliban."

### The Money Flow Process

**Step 1: Origin**
- Cash: $40 million per week
- From Erbil and Iraq
- Loaded on charter planes

**Step 2: Arrival**
- Arrives at Kabul International Airport
- Under control of Sirajuddin Haqqani

**Step 3: Transport**
- Convoy arranged by Haqqani
- Takes $40 million to Afghanistan International Bank (AIB)

**Step 4: First Conversion**
- AIB doesn't have authorization to convert dollars to Afghanis
- Gives money to Taliban-controlled Central Bank of Afghanistan (like Federal Reserve)

**Central Bank Manager:**
**Haji Muhammad Idris** (Ahmadzai)
- Sanctioned terrorist
- Sanctioned by United States for financing bomb attacks against American soldiers
- Killed many American soldiers
- Still sanctioned
- Gets $40 million weekly

**Step 5: Money Market Control**
- Central Bank has monopoly over Afghanistan's money market rates
- Invites money exchangers to bid
- Exchangers are companies affiliated with Haqqani Network and Senior Taliban leadership
- Winners are "individuals associated with the Haqqani Network"
- They control money market
- Take a cut during conversion

**Step 6: Distribution to NGOs**
- Afghanis given back to Afghanistan International Bank
- AIB deposits money into bank accounts of NGOs
- About 2,500 Afghan NGOs
- About 300 international NGOs (including American NGOs)

### NGO Control by Taliban

**License Requirement:**
Every Afghan NGO - their licenses and permits to operate were given by the Taliban

**Legend:**
"If you go and you open an NGO in Afghanistan the Taliban will not give you a license because you're anti-Taliban. So all of those NGOs are pro-Taliban, they're sympathetic towards the Taliban and they get their licenses."

**Board Membership:**
Every NGO collecting from this fund must have Taliban representative on board
- Complete control of money distribution

**NGO Infiltration:**
Long-standing NGOs with State Department relationships
- Taliban "gutted them completely, put all Taliban in them"
- State Department claims "12-year relationship, good record"
- Not being honest: "None of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"

### Purchasing and Second Conversion

**Procurement:**
- 50% of materials from abroad
- 50% purchased in Afghanistan (rice, wheat, flour, oil, medicine)
- Can ONLY purchase from pre-approved Taliban vendor list
- "Cannot buy from Mullah Shawn Ryan's Afghan store"
- Must buy from Taliban-operated stores

**Foreign Purchases:**
- Materials from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan
- Must pay in dollars
- NGOs reconvert money through Central Bank
- Taliban take another cut during second conversion

**Step 7: Transfer to Dubai**
- Money moved to UAE/Dubai
- Bank that moves money: **Azizi Bank**
  - "It's not even a bank, it's a Ponzi scheme"
  - Managed by Taliban

**Step 8: Bulk Orders**
- NGOs order bulk materials (tons of rice, wheat, medicine, medical equipment)
- Transfer materials to Kabul International Airport

**Company: Habib Group**
- Brings materials for NGOs
- Owned partially by brother of current Foreign Minister of Taliban
- Takes cut by charging for services

**Step 9: Customs**
- Moment aid lands at Kabul International Airport
- Taliban charge customs, taxes, and fees
- Another cut taken

**Step 10: Distribution**
- Aid arrives at NGO offices
- List of recipients provided by Taliban
- "5 poor and hungry Afghans"
- "95 Taliban fighters, families of suicide bombers"
- All from U.S. taxpayer dollars

### U.S. Aid Distributed in Taliban's Name

**Legend:**
"In Badman Province which does not have a lot of Taliban support historically, USAID would go and distribute the aid, you will see the logo of USAID all over. President Saleh exposed this, his intelligence exposed this."

**The Distribution:**
- NGOs affiliated with USAID distribute aid
- Alongside Taliban commanders
- "Distribute the aid not in the name of the generosity of the American people or in the name of Joe Biden"
- "Distribute the aid in honor of Mullah Hibatullah and the Taliban"

**Panjshir Province:**
- Zero Taliban support
- Pro-resistance, sympathetic toward resistance
- Taliban goes with NGO called "Ansar"
- Lineup of Afghans and widows
- Envelopes with $200 cash per family
- Taliban tells them: "During the days of the Republic did those infidel Republicans that were puppets of America did they ever come and give you aid? Unlike them, see the leader of the Taliban loves you so much he's giving you aid, he's sending you money"

**U.S. Cash Distributed:**
"In honor of Mullah Hibatullah not in the name of the generosity of the American people"

**Missing American Flag:**
"Even US Aid packages that go to Afghanistan, the US flag is missing from it. In Latin America and Africa and elsewhere around the world when USAID has distributed aid packages there's always an American flag with a message from the American people. Not in Taliban control Afghanistan. They do not want people to know that this aid comes from the American people. They say this aid comes from Mullah Hibatullah."

### Counterterrorism Dollars

**Separate from Humanitarian:**
Come in as U.S. cash, "go all over the place"

**Uses:**
1. Foreign fighters (humanitarian dollars)
2. Homeland plot (counterterrorism dollars)
3. Money laundering through Azizi Bank to support U.S. homeland plot
4. Other plots against Americans (not in United States)

**Embassy Plots:**
Taking physical U.S. dollars cash from Afghanistan, bringing to Africa

**Two Current Embassy Plots:**
1. U.S. Embassy in Bamako, Mali
2. U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia

**Somalia Context:**
- Biggest concern right now
- Next push of caliphate plan
- Push U.S. government out of Somalia
- Somalia fall to Al-Shabaab or ISIS
- Really part of Al-Qaeda's caliphate plan (just like Syria)

**Sarah Adams:**
"We are actually funding with these dollars we send to fight ISIS, plots against us in Africa of all places besides here in the homeland. It's insane that we're funding these incidents that are going to kill Americans."

**The Coming Blame:**
"Think of how that's going to come back right. We have some Americans die let's say Mogadishu, we have a bombing go off in Virginia, and then when you track the money down the money came from the US government. But think of how Americans are going to handle this and that's what the terrorists want. They want you to blame your government."

### Department of Defense Funding

**Beyond USAID and State:**
"We don't just have a problem with USAID, we don't just have a problem with State Department, we have a problem with the money the Department of Defense is giving to the Taliban, we have problem with money CIA is giving to the Taliban"

**Example - Operation Sentinel:**
Department of Defense paid $60 million last year supposedly for women's education in Afghanistan
- Taliban don't even allow Afghan women to leave their homes
- "They said they gave 60 million for women's education when women can't go to school"
- Gave $11 million for Taliban to register their broken arms

**Sarah Adams:**
"We have to be honest about all these pockets of money because you can't stop them if you don't discuss all of them"

### Taliban Martyr Payments

**Critical Issue:**
U.S. paying welfare to Taliban martyr families
- Every Taliban member who died fighting U.S. forces
- U.S. government paying stipend to family
- American Gold Star families "aren't getting squat"

**Justification Given:**
"One person gave answer: 'It'll stop them from joining ISIS'"

**Sarah Adams Response:**
"The Taliban guy is already dead"

## Afghan Passport Production

### The Scale

**Since 2021:**
- 7 million Afghan passports printed in Europe
- Shipped to Afghanistan
- Permission granted by United States State Department

**Ongoing:**
"There's probably going to print a million more passports this year, more than a million"

**Who Controls Permission:**
United States State Department grants permission whether to print or not

**The Problem:**
"We all know where the passports go to: Sirajuddin [Haqqani]"

**Why Afghanistan Can't Produce:**
"Afghanistan cannot produce its own passport booklets just like it cannot produce its own currency"

### Sirajuddin Haqqani

**Profile:**
- Minister of Interior, Afghanistan
- Father of suicide bombing in Afghanistan
- Killed over 1,000 American service members in Afghanistan
- Wanted by FBI
- $10 million reward (or was - State Department unclear)

**Ambassador Decker's Refusal:**
On AMU TV (Afghan news show), host Sam asked Ambassador Karen Decker:
"Is Sirajuddin Haqqani still a terrorist? Is the State Department still looking for him?"

**Her Response:**
"She says she cannot answer these questions. She refuses to call Haqqani a wanted terrorist."

### Passports as Terrorist Travel Documents

**Sarah Adams:**
"We're also not treating these passports as compromised which is insane right, so they don't even act like the Afghan passports are compromised even though any terrorists can travel to Afghanistan and get their name changed and their face put on one of these passports"

**What She's Seen:**
- Algerian faces on Afghan passports
- Libyan faces on Afghan passports
- Syrian faces on Afghan passports
- Any nationality can get Afghan passport with new identity

**The Process:**
Terrorists travel to Afghanistan, Sirajuddin Haqqani issues passport with:
- New name
- Their face
- Afghan nationality (false)
- Complete new identity

## Intelligence from the Resistance

### Commander Khalid Amiri Letter

**Position:**
- Afghan Commando
- General
- Leading resistance in Afghanistan since 2021

**Letter Content (read by Legend):**
"The strength of any military force relies on six principles: leadership, discipline, institution building, technology and weaponry, strategy and support systems. Taliban factions and militias are not only unfamiliar with these principles but the equipment and weapons left behind by Afghan armed forces are inadequate to meet the group's long-term needs. At best the Taliban remain an insurgent group lacking the capacity for institution building and governance."

"The armed struggle of Afghanistan's freedom fighters over the past three years and the significant casualties they have inflicted on Taliban militias demonstrate the group's vulnerability in military and intelligence terms. A powerful and united anti-Taliban front could bring the Taliban to their knees."

"Taliban leaders and militias are unfamiliar with the diverse languages and cultures of Afghan society and will never gain national or popular legitimacy. The people of Afghanistan both in cities and rural areas view them as occupiers. The populace is fed up with the repressive anti-woman and anti-freedom rule of the Taliban and it will not be long before our people's uprising will drive them out of our land."

**Legend's Statement:**
"He tells you that the Taliban are very much defeatable. President Saleh says the Taliban are very much defeatable. I hope somebody in the administration, in the new administration, listens to this letter that I just read and takes action."

### Multiple Resistance Fronts

**Groups Fighting Taliban:**
1. President Amrullah Saleh leading Afghanistan Green Trend (AGT)
2. Commander Ahmed Massoud leading National Resistance Front
3. General Khalid Amiri leading resistance fighters
4. Various other resistance pockets across Afghanistan

**Legend:**
"There are several resistance fronts. You met Commander Ahmed Massoud the leader of the national resistance front. There's also President Amrullah Saleh who's leading Afghanistan Green Trend."

### The Tragedy

**Legend:**
"It will be a tragedy, a very sad tragedy, if the guys that we trained in Afghanistan to fight terrorists, we end up fighting those guys here in America."

**The Solution:**
U.S. should support the resistance forces - the actual allies who fought alongside America for 20 years, not the Taliban who killed Americans.

## Congressional Action on Funding

### HR 26 - No Tax Dollars for Terrorist Act

**Sponsor:**
Congressman Tim Burchett (Tennessee)

**Status:**
- Bill is ready
- Waiting for Speaker Mike Johnson to put it on House floor for vote
- Senate version introduced by Senator Tim Sheehy (Montana)
- Both bills ready, waiting for vote

**What It Covers:**
1. Direct money to Taliban ($40-105 million per week)
2. NGOs (Taliban fronts)
3. Afghan Fund (managed by pro-Taliban Afghan Americans)

**Legend's Testimony:**
"Congressman Tim Burchett we could not have done this without him. He's an amazing human being, he's become a very good friend. His entire office have been professional and very helpful whether it's his district office in Knoxville or DC office - John Kelsey, everyone was super helpful in this legislation."

### The Delay

**Current Holdup:**
Needs Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to call for vote

**Tim Burchett's Strategy:**
Wants bill introduced as single bill without attachments
- So nobody has excuse to vote against it
- No other items attached that give reason to vote no
- Hold people accountable who vote against it

**Senate:**
Senator Tim Sheehy introduced carbon copy at Senate
"Both bills are ready, it's just waiting for Senator John Thune and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to put it up for a vote"

### Admission of Funding

**No Longer Deniable:**
- Initially government denied sending money
- Then attacked those reporting it, said they were lying
- Secretary Blinken finally admitted "yes we gave a few million dollars to the Taliban"
- President Trump admitted "yes the money does end up going to the Taliban and is going to the Taliban"
- Elon Musk has repeated it
- "There is no denying it, everyone admits"

**Legend's Thanks:**
"I have so much to thank you for and officially on behalf of the entire resistance, on behalf of President Saleh, Commander Massoud, let me thank you once again for taking that cause. It means a lot."

**The Issue:**
"It's very troubling that US taxpayer money goes to the very individuals who killed not only Afghans but American soldiers as well"

### Who Supported

**House Members:**
- Congressman Tim Burchett (lead sponsor)
- Congressman Eli Crane (very helpful)
- Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (very helpful)
- Anna Paulina Luna (helpful)
- And others

**Shawn Ryan Show Role:**
"Without you and your supporters who made calls and wrote letters to Congress we would not have had this much movement. This would not have gotten anywhere."

## NGO Corruption and Taliban Control

### The Gutting of NGOs

**Long-Standing Organizations:**
NGOs with 12-year State Department relationships

**What Happened:**
Taliban "gutted them completely, put all Taliban in them"

**State Department Claims:**
"12-year relationship, good record"

**Reality:**
"Not being honest - none of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"

### Board Membership Requirements

**Taliban Control Mechanism:**
Every NGO collecting from humanitarian fund must have Taliban representative on board

**Result:**
Complete control of money distribution decisions

### Pre-Approved Vendor Lists

**Purchasing Restrictions:**
- NGOs can only buy from vendors on Taliban-approved list
- Cannot buy from any other Afghan businesses
- All vendors are Taliban-operated or Taliban-affiliated
- Taliban profit from every transaction

### The 70% Siphoning

**Reality:**
70% siphoned off to Taliban-only causes
- Majority goes to Taliban military
- Not just basic bribes
- Systematic corruption at every step

**Methods:**
1. Currency conversion cuts (twice)
2. Board membership control
3. Vendor list restrictions
4. Transport company fees
5. Customs and taxes
6. Recipient list control

---

## Community Preparedness and Defense

### The Strategic Crossroads

**Scott Mann:**
"We're kind of at a crossroads right now. You either believe at this point that there is a viable threat against the homeland that is complex, local, distributed, looks more like October 7 than it does 9/11, that is very likely in the next year or two, or you don't."

**If You Believe:**
"In addition to the analysis we should start...what could we...what could if it's a duty to warn up, maybe it's a duty to prepare down and in, how could we help that conversation"

### Why Communities Must Prepare

**Scott Mann's Analysis:**
"This one has followed us home...when it's where you live and you work and you play they have figured that out. If you look at their attacks over the last 10 years every single time every single time it's local complex attacks right where we live work and play."

**Crisis Response Capability:**
"A crisis expended the capability of the organic response force in minutes like that. You couldn't, they couldn't respond, they could not, they were not effective. What you saw were individuals and communities that were on their own."

**Examples:**
- Western North Carolina hurricane
- East Palestine Ohio chemical spill
- West Maui fires
- All organic response forces overwhelmed immediately

### Hardening Targets

**The Principle:**
"These guys they look for soft targets and so if you harden your community then guess what they see that because these guys always surveil before they hit, they always do surveillance before they hit"

**Types of Surveillance:**
1. Internet surveillance
2. In-person surveillance of venues
3. Surveillance of people
4. Pattern of life analysis

**Creating Discussion:**
"If you create that discussion however you do it, it gives the appearance that let's not hit this community, they're getting their shit together, it's a discussion, they're preparing for it, it pushes it over to the next county, pushes it over to the next state"

### Case Study: Pulse Nightclub

**Original Target:**
Disney Springs (downtown Disney area)

**Surveillance:**
Shooter and his wife did surveillance, chose it as target, had gun in stroller

**What Happened:**
Too much Disney security that day when he arrived
- Got back in car
- Drove around
- Thought of another venue
- Picked Pulse Nightclub later

**Result:**
"Horrible thing happened but Disney having their security and upping their posture from the time he surveilled and said I'm going to do it to going back and having more security he said okay this isn't worth it for me"

**The Lesson:**
"We all harden right, we make all these targets more difficult, we keep thwarting them in that way. When people have to change the venue of their target it might not be the same day like he did, they might have to do a week later. That gives law enforcement one more week to maybe identify him and thwart him right. We want to thwart this plot. We want to stop it from happening. Buying time and making the terrorists have to hide out longer, spend more money, that helps us get them faster."

## Case Studies: Mumbai, October 7, New Orleans

### 2008 Mumbai Attacks

**The Attack:**
- 10 terrorists
- Locked down city of 19 million
- Complex attacks
- Holding terrain
- Well over 100 people killed
- "Almost a foreshadowing of what we think we could expect here in the homeland"

**Terrorist Training:**
- 35 candidates initially groomed
- 10 were selected
- 9 of 10 fought to the death
- Knew they were not coming out
- "We've just never faced anything with that"

**Scott Mann:**
"One law enforcement officer that I interview does a lot of tactical training around the country, he watches your show diligently and he contacted me and he said Scott I train all over the country I train SWAT teams, advanced tactics. He said I'm telling you right now we're not ready for this in terms of response primarily because the typical scenario that we deal with are single shooters. One active [shooter]. We do not deal with teams of 8 to 10 that are prepared to fight to the death."

### October 7, 2023 - Israel

**IDF Intelligence Analyst Warnings:**
Four separate IDF intelligence analysts interviewed by Shawn Ryan
All said the same thing:

"We live this every day, we live this in our communities, we're always facing this imminent threat. It's something that we've kind of come to terms with and we were completely caught off guard like we were not ready for this, we were not ready for what came our way."

**Their Warning to America:**
"You all have not even allowed yourself to even think about this. They have been among you for four years. It is going to be 10x what they did to us on October 7."

**To the man and woman they said that - separate interviews**

**Al-Qaeda's Plan:**
"Al-Qaeda planned this [the Hamas attacks], they were involved in planning. They planned a US homeland attack to be 10 times the size of the Hamas attacks. To them the Hamas attacks was the dress rehearsal."

**Sarah Adams:**
"The attack on us is going to be a lot larger"

### Crocus City Music Hall (Russia)

**The Attack:**
- ISIS hit in Russia
- Complex attack
- Incendiary devices
- Set place ablaze
- Extremely well-armed (long guns, short guns, grenades)
- Taking time to cut throats
- Making sure it was covered and amplified

**The Backup Team:**
First team was thrown in and wrapped up
- Russians thought they stopped the plot
- Then backup team came in and successfully did the attack
- "That's very smart and we're not used to those kind of tactics"

**Sarah Adams:**
"We can even have people in the government and we do have people like they picked up like eight ISIS guys last year and think they thwarted the homeland plot. The terrorists are also doing things to make you think okay you're ahead of the game, you stopped this, and then they had a whole backup team that went in and successfully did that attack."

### New Orleans Bourbon Street Attack

**Mentioned as recent example**
Referenced in context of local attacks

### Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Festival

**The Scenario:**
- Tens of thousands of people
- Single shooter from Mandalay Hotel
- More than 10 weapons with bump stocks
- Took police over an hour to get into his room
- He was already dead

**The Paralysis:**
"An hour single shooter...if you just look at the level of paralysis that happens from that, you add to that 7, 8, 10 well-trained operatives like you saw in that video right who then hit multiple nodes at one time and who have a pre-existing mandate to hold terrain with explosives and children out of school"

**70% Survival Due to First Aid:**
"They say 70% of the people who survived survived because the people in their vicinity had first aid training. A lot of it was former military members but those citizens stepped up and did the initial triage and the initial aid and it saved 70% of those people."

### DC Sniper

**Comparative Impact:**
"9/11 attack happened - explosion, F-16s flying supersonic just above the treetops and right over here the McDonald's was still open, people still getting food."

**Versus:**
"DC sniper - two dudes in the back of a car for 3 weeks - the entire city was paralyzed in lockdown, people on a knee getting gas, kids not going outside to play"

**The Difference:**
"That's the difference. There's the spectacular thing that's over there but then there's where you live and you work and you play and they have figured that out."

---

## The Gathering Storm Project

### Genesis of the Book

**Scott Mann:**
"You asked a question about okay so what do communities do and that opened up was a really broad conversation that's still ongoing where individuals and communities I know they started hitting you up, they started hitting me up, they started hitting Sarah up - what do we do in our community? How do we defend our synagogue or our church or our place of worship? Is this something we should be thinking about?"

**The Title:**
Borrowing from Winston Churchill when he tried to warn of the gathering storm in World War II

### Purpose and Approach

**Not Creating Panic:**
"We just looked at unclassified case studies, and we just looked at scenarios that have happened in the past of where we get hit or other places get hit where they live work and play"

**Case Studies Analyzed:**
1. DC Sniper
2. Beslan School Siege (Chechens, over 1,000 children in gymnasium, explosives on basketball goals, Russian Special Forces held at bay)
3. 2008 Mumbai
4. October 7, 2023
5. New Orleans Bourbon Street
6. Others

**Methodology:**
"A lot like how US Army Special Ops Command and others do case studies - they'll take they'll migrate those practical lessons learned into operators modern times. That's what we did."

### Key Finding

**Scott Mann:**
"What surprised me was we came up with a lot more questions than we did answers."

**Different in Every Location:**
"It's different in every county, it's different in every municipality because context is everything but if these attacks are going to be locally manifested then that's where the conversations need to start because that's going to be the real resilience."

**Questions Over Answers:**
"Where we didn't have the answers we just put the questions in there - here's what communities should be asking themselves. Hopefully more books will be written that are technically specific on those questions and we just keep it going."

### Finding People Who Responded

**Surprising Discovery:**
"One the relative ease of finding people who were on the ground or who responded to those events. Even Mumbai, October 7, just doing peer-to-peer discussions on lessons learned was super eye-opening and I think something that's available to law enforcement, emergency operation centers across the country."

**Example:**
Israeli Special Forces NCO Dan Kadar
- Travels around U.S.
- Talks to churches about October 7
- Responded to Nova Music Festival
- Went into neighborhoods that were slaughtered
- Can give real insights

### Individual Takeaways

**Scott Mann:**
"At an individual level the first thing is to do own research, to not let fear dominate but to question things. To question what we're saying. To look at a lot of these case studies, to look at a lot of the examples on your own. I think that for you and your family this is not just terrorism, this is any crisis, but for certainly for terrorism I think you should look at the threat itself and then you should look at scenarios that have been similar to that and between those two things you can derive a lot of insights on kind of what you should be doing."

**Daily Pattern of Life:**
"Think about how would these scenarios unfold. Look at your daily pattern of life. What are the local cafes that you go to, where is your local movie theater, where's your daycare, where do your kids go to school, what are the gatherings that you typically go to throughout the year? Do you go to a lot of concerts, do you go to ball games? Start to just look at those with intention and starting to ask yourself hard questions about okay if I looked at for example the Nova Music Festival, I look at the Crocus City Music Hall where ISIS hit, what are things that I can derive from that that I could look at the places that I go to in my [area]?"

**Agency Not Fear:**
"I think my big takeaway for individuals is look at the scenarios that have already happened because that takes the fear away I think and really puts agency back in ourselves to just look pragmatically at things that have happened in the past."

## Red Cell and Penetration Testing

### What Is a Red Cell?

**Scott Mann:**
"I believe every emergency operation center, county sheriff should have a red cell. They should have a red cell that looks at threat-based scenario work because both exist."

**Definition:**
Red Cell is penetration testing for venues, events, security postures
- Find weaknesses
- Test security
- Think like terrorists

**Shawn Ryan:**
"Red cell is basically penetration testing for whatever could be venues, events, whatever and so you're basically penetration testing, finding weaknesses within that venue."

### How to Implement

**Don't Need On-Duty Officers:**
"You don't have to send, you don't have to allocate a bunch of on-duty officers to do penetration testing to different venues. You could have off-duty guys do it, you could have deputies, whoever."

**The Test:**
"Just hey I just want to let you know my guy walked in, had a gun, had a knife, had this, had that, nobody checked me. I'm an off-duty cop, I'm allowed to carry anywhere, and I just want you to you know hold the venues accountable."

**Chapel Hill Example:**
Scott Mann went to Carolina-Duke basketball game at Dean Smith Center (21,000 seat capacity)
- Not one metal detector in main primary entry points
- Only search: if you declared a bag
- No metal detectors at 21,000 seat venue

"Anyone I would hope watching or hearing this sits up at that because that's new and I got to believe that's not isolated to Chapel Hill."

### Questions Red Cell Should Ask

**Question 1: First Responder Uniforms**
"How would we handle in this county an incident where groups of 8 to 10 well-trained terror operatives donned first responder uniforms? How would we handle that as a community? How would we communicate that to a community? How would first responders actually talk to themselves on the fact that that was happening and is there a way that they could overcome that with a different uniform or something like I don't know the answer but that is a legitimate question."

**Question 2: Systemic Paralysis**
"How would our community respond if the terror attack happened in such a way that there was complete paralysis across all first responders? If you had systemic paralysis for at least 24 to 48 hours where there was no real response?"

**Why Paralysis:**
1. Overwhelmed
2. Targeted (first responders ran right at them, they took them out)
3. Reinforcements coming but complete confusion
4. Terror groups in first responder uniforms
5. Some areas cut off where they held terrain

**Examples:**
- Mumbai: Held terrain
- Beslan School: Basketball goals with explosives, children in middle - how do you assault that?

---

## Local Law Enforcement Briefing

### The Briefing

**Attendees:**
- Shawn Ryan's County Sheriff's Office
- City Police Department
- Neighboring PDs
- Multiple federal agencies
- Multiple state agencies
- Department of Higher Education

**Scott Mann:**
"Very receptive. I was really happy with how that went. I want to do everything I can to protect the community that I live in and all the kids and the people that live here. They seem very receptive."

### Primary Concern: Resources

**The Challenge:**
Allocation of resources

**Current Situation:**
- Police already understaffed (last 4 years defund the police)
- Sheriff's offices understaffed
- Even federal and state levels understaffed

**Need to Think About:**
1. Allocation of resources
2. How fast resources get used up
3. Neighboring PDs
4. Neighboring Sheriff's offices
5. State assets
6. Federal assets
7. How to help each other

### Solutions Discussed

**1. Route Planning**
Even if can't allocate officers to develop plan:
- Reach out to community
- Find qualified people within community
- Have them develop routes
- Multiple routes into every venue

**Shawn Ryan's Example:**
"In 2004, 16 guys [SEALs], we went into Athens and we developed five routes into every Olympic venue in Athens, outside of Athens, how we would get there."

**Military Experience:**
"How many times were you feeling a target, it was blocked and then you had to deviate, find another route in? We're really good at this type of stuff."

**Just Start:**
"You have to start somewhere. I don't want it to seem like an impossible task. I think the important thing is just start."

**2. Communication**

**The Problem:**
It would be very likely there would be no comms

**Solution:**
Order some mini Starlinks
- At least have communication from on-site where attack happened
- To headquarters
- To Sheriff's Department
- To PD
- Right there you have open comms

**3. Blockades and Traffic**

**Expectation:**
- Expect blockades
- Expect not to be able to reach venues
- Even after scene clear: traffic jams
- Roads blocked
- Everybody in paralysis
- Can't move

**4. Utilize Community Expertise**

**Global War on Terror Veterans:**
"The asset that we have that we are not properly utilizing: our communities. Our communities have a lot of potential."

**What They Did:**
- Afghanistan collapse response
- West Maui fires
- Western North Carolina hurricanes
- East Palestine

**Capability:**
"These GWOT veterans they have spent 20 years of their life doing this kind of work in a distributed connected kind of way and they're going to do it no matter what. If there's institutional paralysis, if there's a gap, they're going to fill it."

**Why Not Plan Together:**
"Why not on your tabletop exercises at a community level in the EOC invite them in, huddle around the table and make it a true private-public conversation around a community problem?"

### Florida Model

**Special Missions Unit:**
Florida set up National Guard special missions unit
- Utilized Special Operations veterans
- Volunteer special unit
- Task force

**Sheriff Nocco - Pasco County:**
"Really good at engaging local veterans and not just for their analytical skills on the Intel side but also their operational skills. They fought in Ramadi, they fought in Fallujah, they know how to do a threat vulnerability assessment of schools."

**All Hands on Deck:**
"It's kind of all hands on deck man honestly. The asset that we have that we are not properly utilizing: our communities."

---

## Medical Preparedness and First Aid

### The Problem

**EMS Response:**
- Have to wait until scene is clear of threat
- Even after: traffic jams, roads blocked
- May not be able to reach for extended period

### The Solution

**Cache Medical Supplies:**
- Get 100 tourniquets
- Chest seals
- Bandages
- All that kind of stuff
- Stash in different churches
- Stash in different venues

**Distribution:**
Make it open just like AEDs
- Here's the medical supplies
- We can't get there
- Roads are blocked
- You guys we set up for this

**Communication:**
If comms work even partially:
- Call comes in to department
- "By the way there's an entire medical cache of supplies stashed in the janitor closet at a mall"
- Or make location open/known in advance

### Medical Training

**Not High Tactics:**
"I'm not talking about high tactics, clearing rooms, that kind of stuff"

**Basic Skills:**
"If you're a community leader, if you're a minister, if you're a pastor, if you're a teacher, if you're a principal, if you're a manager of a Publix, a grocery store - a little bit of medical training can go a very very long way and there's always people that are interested in doing this."

**What to Train:**
- Slapping a tourniquet on
- Basic triage
- First aid
- Stopping bleeding
- Basic life-saving skills

**Impact:**
Can mean life or death for a whole number of people

### Las Vegas Example

**70% Survival Rate:**
"They say 70% of the people who survived survived because the people in their vicinity had first aid training and a lot of it was former military members but those citizens stepped up and did the initial triage and the initial aid and it saved 70% of those people."

**The Numbers:**
"That's a huge number and that alone should just get communities involved. Hey if we know how to do this, look at the amount of number of lives you save."

### Standoffs for Suicide Bombers

**Sarah Adams:**
"Even simple things - what kind of standoff should we just have from a metal detector? We should start those standoffs now right because then if the bomber gets freaked out, blows up, you save lives just by putting a standoff going up to the metal detector."

**Learning About Suicide Bombers:**
- Bring in people who fought in Ramadi, Fallujah
- Have them talk
- Be consultants, advisors
- Tell what it was like to fight that enemy
- "What's it like to fight someone who wants to fight to the death?"

## Conclusion

This episode represents a critical warning from three intelligence professionals who maintain the relationships and intelligence networks the U.S. government abandoned. The convergence of their independent intelligence sources all pointing to over 1,000 terrorist operatives already in the United States, combined with continued U.S. funding of the Taliban regime at $40-105 million per week, represents an unprecedented national security crisis.

**Key Themes:**
1. Syrian takeover was planned by same terrorist networks (Taliban/Al-Qaeda) that control Afghanistan
2. Christians and minorities being systematically slaughtered in Syria
3. U.S. funding the Taliban while they harbor and deploy terrorists to America
4. Taliban sympathizers embedded throughout U.S. government blocking action
5. Resistance forces (America's actual allies) abandoned and intelligence ignored
6. Community-level preparedness critical as federal response will be inadequate
7. Attack on U.S. soil expected to be "10 times the size of October 7"
8. Time to act is extremely limited

**The Intelligence Paradox:**
The U.S. government abandoned 98-99% of its human intelligence assets in Afghanistan, and now relies on the Taliban (the enemy) for intelligence while ignoring the resistance forces (our allies) who provide the most reliable intelligence.

**The Funding Scandal:**
American taxpayer money ($40-105 million per week) goes through a systematic laundering process where Taliban take cuts at every step, then distribute aid in Taliban's name, while paying stipends to families of Taliban fighters who died killing Americans.

**The Community Imperative:**
With federal government compromised by Taliban sympathizers and institutional paralysis likely during attacks, communities must prepare now using veteran expertise, red cell analysis, medical caching, route planning, and private-public partnerships at unprecedented scale.

**The Warning:**
Every expert interviewed - from IDF analysts to GWOT veterans to Afghan resistance - gives the same warning: An attack is coming, it will be larger than October 7, Americans haven't even allowed themselves to think about it, and there is very little time to prepare.

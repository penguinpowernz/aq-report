## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive funding report documents money flows from the United States government and other state actors to terrorist organizations, revealing a systematic pattern of funding that directly supports training camps, operational planning, and attacks against U.S. interests. The U.S. government delivers between $44-87 million per week to the Taliban, along with billions in additional funding streams, while maintaining the fiction that this money goes to humanitarian aid. In reality, at least 70% of these funds are siphoned to Taliban military operations and Al-Qaeda training camps where 1,000+ terrorists have been trained for attacks on U.S. soil. Additional state funding comes from China ($10 billion investment with $3 billion to Al-Qaeda), Iran, Russia, India, and others, creating an unprecedented multi-state funding network supporting terrorism.

### Key Financial Flows Identified:

- Weekly cash deliveries: $44-87 million
- Taliban Political Office Qatar: $10 million/month (since 2013, 11+ years)

- Refugee program fraud: $5 million/month directly to Al-Qaeda camps
- Swiss bank account: $3.5 billion (Government of Afghanistan reserves)
- ISIS counterterrorism dollars: Classified amounts

**Other State Actors:**
- Chinese investment: $10 billion ($3 billion to Al-Qaeda)
- Iranian stipends to Taliban leadership
- Russian support for operations
- Indian payments: $10 million to Mullah Yaqub for Bagram base

**Congressional Response:**

### Origin and Distribution

**Total:** $7 billion in Government of Afghanistan reserves when it fell (held offshore in U.S.)

**Distribution of $7 Billion:**

**$3.5 billion:** Allocated to 9/11 victims
- **Problem:** Sarah Adams hasn't met anyone besides lawyers who received money

**$3.5 billion:** Moved to Swiss bank account

**Total Since 2013:** $1.32 billion+ (11 years)

**Source:** U.S. government funding

**Purpose (Official):** Diplomatic liaison office for Taliban representation

**Purpose (Actual):** Taliban international headquarters receiving U.S. funding while planning operations against U.S.

- Making several million dollars monthly total

**The Money Trail:**
Sarah Adams' team "followed the money" - discovered money from plane doesn't all go to Afghan International Bank, goes to eight other destinations weekly (detailed in Eight Stops section)

**Purpose (Official):** Taliban supposed to hunt ISIS with U.S. funding

**Purpose (Actual):**
- Taliban GDI "only goes after ISIS if ISIS impacts Taliban"
- Money goes to designated terrorists
- Some goes directly to Al-Qaeda leaders
- Funds terrorist operations

**Taliban Strategy with ISIS:**
- Need ISIS to remain threat

## MONEY SIPHONING MECHANISMS

### The 70% Diversion

**Official Narrative:** Money goes to humanitarian aid

**Reality:** 70% siphoned off to Taliban-only causes

**Majority Recipient:** Taliban military

**Methods of Diversion:**

### 1. Basic Bribes

**Doesn't account for 70%** - too small scale

- Direct payoffs at distribution points
- Corruption at bank level
- Kickbacks to officials
- Not sufficient to explain full 70%

### 2. Board Membership Requirement

**Every NGO collecting from this fund must have Taliban representative on board**

**Effect:**
- Complete control of money distribution
- Taliban vote on all spending
- Taliban direct funds to preferred causes
- Taliban veto humanitarian projects
- Ensures money goes to Taliban priorities

**Implementation:**
- Mandatory for all NGOs operating in Afghanistan
- No board seat = no access to funds
- Taliban representative controls decisions
- NGOs become Taliban fronts

### 3. NGO Infiltration and Gutting

**Long-standing NGOs with State Department relationships:**

**State Department Claims:**
- "12-year relationship"
- "Good record"
- "Trusted organizations"

**Reality:**
- Taliban "gutted them completely"
- "Put all Taliban in them"
- State Department not being honest
- "None of them work there anymore"
- "It's all now just Taliban"

**Process:**
- Established NGO with good reputation
- Taliban replaces all staff
- Keeps NGO name and contracts
- State Department pretends not to notice
- Money flows to same name, different organization
- Actually flows directly to Taliban

**Example Organizations:**
- Multiple NGOs Adams tracked
- All infiltrated and taken over
- State Department maintains fiction of legitimacy
- Money laundering through humanitarian cover

### 4. Afghanistan International Bank

**Role:** Receives weekly cash plane delivery

**Profit:** Making "huge money" from exchange of this volume

**Process:**
1. Money taken from plane
2. Brought to bank
3. Supposedly distributed to humanitarian aid
4. Bank takes cut on exchange
5. Bank facilitates Taliban diversions
6. 70% goes to Taliban causes

**Volume:**
- $44-87 million weekly
- $2.3-4.5 billion annually
- Enormous exchange fees
- Captive banking system
- No alternatives available

---

## CHINESE INVESTMENT - $10 BILLION

### The Investment

**Total:** $10 billion Chinese investment in Afghanistan

**Key Fact:** "$3 of every $10 gets allocated to Al-Qaeda" = **$3 billion to Al-Qaeda**

**Distribution:**
- Al-Qaeda keeps some for operations
- Gives some to affiliates:
  - TTP (Pakistani Taliban)
  - IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan)

**IMU:** Another group sending terrorists to U.S. southern border

### Beyond Lithium - The Real Strategy

**Official Focus:** Lithium mining (for batteries, green energy)

**Real Strategy:**

**China-Iran Oil Deal:**
- If U.S. comes to war with China "and shit hits the fan"
- China will get oil from Iran
- **Afghanistan will be used as land route for Iranian oil**
- China worried U.S. will cut off oil supplies from South America or Africa
- Land route insurance through Afghanistan
- Belt and Road Initiative component

### Bagram Air Base

**Strategic Importance:**
- "One of more key strategic bases in world"
- Now where **Chinese PMCs (private military contractors) are based**
- Chinese military presence at former U.S. base
- Strategic positioning for regional operations

**Funding:** $10 million Indian payment to Mullah Yaqub funded Bagram base

**Use:** Hibatullah's (supreme Taliban leader) personal security based at Bagram

### Uranium Mines

**Location:** At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan (beyond lithium)

**Ownership:** "Essentially owned and run by China"

**Present at Mines:**
- Chinese personnel
- Al-Qaeda operatives
- IRGC representatives (helping Al-Qaeda)
- "Same building" - all together

**Purpose:**
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- Not nuclear weapons ("not exactly")
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- Radiological weapons development
- Chinese aware and allowing it

**Long-term Strategy:**
- China viewing terrorists as potential proxies
- If U.S.-China war occurs, China will likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Longer game than Russia
- Building relationships and capabilities now

### Chinese Presence in Afghanistan

**Scale:**
- Northern Alliance reports Chinese officials "everywhere"
- "Building massive hotels right outside of these lithium deposits"
- "Huge multi-million dollar structures"
- Unusual for Afghanistan: "In the middle of nowhere"

**Meetings in Kandahar:**
- Chinese representatives regularly visit
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with other state actors present (Russia, Iran, North Korea)
- Part of broader anti-U.S. coordination

### Taliban-China Relationship History

**Since 2009 (Minimum):**
- Mullah Baradar's job: Liaison from Taliban to Chinese government
- Would travel to China for meetings
- Maintaining relationship with Chinese government

**Chinese Priorities:**
- Primary ask: Taliban collect intelligence on Uighurs
- "Pass it to us"
- "Taliban are reporting on other Muslims to China"
- Taliban betray fellow Muslims for Chinese money

**Taliban Requests:**
- "Help us get weapons or funds for weapons"
- Established bilateral cooperation
- Multi-year partnership

**Current Status (2024):**
- China is first and only country with official ambassador to Taliban government
- "First and only country that has assigned an official ambassador to the Taliban government"
- Others have "weird envoys"
- Demonstrates priority relationship

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "Taliban-China relationship has been stronger than the US-Taliban relationship at least since 2009 for sure"
- "Of course China would be the main party they link up with when they go to [power]"
- Baradar "plays a huge part in the economics piece of this current government"
- "Already positioned to hook China up which was his closest ally before he was captured"

- Terrorists contact Russia: "Is timing okay?"
- Russia: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"
- Russia wanted distraction from Ukraine

**When Delayed:**
- July 2022: Zawahiri killed, Al-Qaeda wants to delay to 2023
- Reached back out to Russia
- Russia: "No, do it in 2022, don't wait, I need pressure off me for Ukraine"

**U.S. Homeland Attack Support:**
- Information suggests Russian pipeline helping bring supplies into U.S.
- Supplies for Al-Qaeda homeland attack
- Moving through Russian channels
- Into United States

**Purpose:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- "Push at us for Ukraine just like we're doing stuff against Russia"
- Use terrorists as proxies against U.S.
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS, not Russia

**ISIS-K Deception:**
- Russia working with Taliban against ISIS-K Branch One (Sanaullah)
- Real threat to Russia: Branch Two (Ghulam Kohistani in north)
- Taliban hiding this from Russia
- Sirajuddin Haqqani funding and protecting Branch Two
- Taliban playing both sides

### Indian Payments

**Amount:** $10 million to Mullah Yaqub

**Purpose:** Funded Bagram base

**Use:** Hibatullah's (Taliban Supreme Leader) personal security based at Bagram

**Questions:**
- "Indian government or intel service funding Hibatullah's personal security - isn't that weird?"
- Not even tons of money compared to U.S. funding
- "What is India getting? What's Taliban getting? They don't give a damn about $10 million"

**The Craziest Thing:**

**India is using Taliban networks to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan**

**Operations:**
- Killing Kashmir militants all over Pakistan (Lahore, Karachi, etc.)
- Also killing Sikh militants
- 18 targeted for assassination
- Groups: Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen
- **Not one from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen** - this is key

**The Theory - Kashmir Future War Plan:**

**Hibatullah Connection:**
- Religious teaching from **Fazal Rahman Khalil** (founded Hizb-ul-Mujahideen)
- Still close friends
- Hibatullah gives U.S. money to HuM and their madrassas

**Strategy:**
- Taliban and HuM decided to work together
- Use India to eliminate Kashmir militants aligned to Pakistan
- India doesn't understand this is what's happening
- Taking out old guard of Kashmir militant leaders (Pakistani loyalists)
- New generation more aligned to Taliban and Al-Qaeda than Pakistani military
- Creating new Kashmir landscape for future war

### Money Laundering Operations

**Libya as Financial Hub:**

**Hashim Abu Cidra (Benghazi attacker):**
- Head of ISIS in Libya
- Head of Al-Qaeda operations in Libya
- Top 10 terrorist globally
- Runs entire Sahel
- Controls weapons, drugs, human trafficking across region
- Operates Al-Qaeda and ISIS as **"billion-dollar organizations"** in Libya
- Run "more as businesses than terrorist groups"

**Operations:**

- Drug trafficking (trans-Saharan routes)
- Human trafficking/smuggling
- Money laundering
- Resource extraction
- Extortion and protection rackets

**Libya Weapons Trade:**
- One of best places in world to buy weapons
- Not old Gaddafi stockpiles - buying brand new weapons
- Sources: Serbia, Ukraine, Turkey
- Haqqani Network purchasing weapons from Libya
- May be to avoid "Property of US Government" markings seen in Pakistan

### Hawala and Informal Transfer Systems

**Traditional Systems:**

- Trust-based value transfer
- No formal banking records
- Impossible to track
- Operates parallel to formal banking

**Afghanistan Focus:**
- Taliban control hawala networks
- Can move money anywhere in world
- No documentation
- No oversight
- Perfect for terrorist financing

- Pakistan to Afghanistan
- Middle East to South Asia
- Gulf States to Afghanistan
- Turkey to anywhere
- Libya to everywhere

## AID DIVERSION AND NGO INFILTRATION

### The 70% Diversion Rate

**Official:** Money goes to humanitarian aid

**Reality:** 70% siphoned to Taliban-only causes, majority to Taliban military

**Scale:**
- $44-87 million weekly × 70% = $30.8-60.9 million weekly to Taliban
- Annual: $1.6-3.2 billion directly to Taliban military and operations

### NGO Takeover Methods

**Historical Pattern:**

**Established NGOs:**
- Long-standing organizations with State Department relationships
- "12-year relationship, good record"
- Trusted by U.S. government
- Receive large contracts and funding

**Taliban Takeover:**
- Taliban "gutted them completely"
- "Put all Taliban in them"
- Replaced all staff
- Kept NGO name, registration, contracts
- State Department pretends not to notice

**Current Status:**
- "None of them work there anymore"
- "It's all now just Taliban"
- State Department not being honest
- Money flows to same name, actually to Taliban
- Perfect money laundering

### Board Membership Requirements

**Policy:** Every NGO collecting from U.S. fund must have Taliban representative on board

**Effect:**
- Complete control of money distribution
- Taliban vote on all spending decisions
- Taliban direct funds to Taliban priorities
- Taliban veto actual humanitarian projects
- NGOs become Taliban-controlled fronts

**No Alternative:**
- Mandatory for all NGOs in Afghanistan
- No board seat = no access to funds
- NGOs must comply or leave
- Creates appearance of legitimacy
- Actually ensures Taliban control

### Kabul Evacuation Example (2021)

**Context:** 120,000 people evacuated during fall of Kabul

**NGO Role:**
- Provided "humanitarian assistance"
- Created "security blankets" for migration
- Made journey easier and safer
- Increased migration volume

**Result:**
- Approximately 70,000 evacuated with unknown identities
- Due to NGO pressure to accept people without proper identification
- "White savior complex" overriding security
- Mix of incompetence and misguided intentions
- Security compromised for humanitarian claims

**Pattern:**
- NGOs prioritize appearance of helping over actual security
- Pressure government to lower standards
- Unknown number of threats included in evacuation
- Same pattern occurring in Afghanistan aid

### State Department Knowledge

**Adams' Assessment:**
- State Department knows NGOs are Taliban fronts
- Chooses to maintain fiction
- "Not being honest about it"
- Protects false narrative
- Continues funding regardless

**Why Continue:**
- Admitting failure would end program
- Political commitment to "humanitarian aid"
- Bureaucratic momentum
- Lack of alternatives
- Nobody held accountable

### CIA Gate Takeover

**Kabul Airport (2021):**
- CIA was "probably the only real government organization moving people out"
- "Taking our allies out, making it happen and doing the right thing"
- State Department took over CIA's gate
- Reason: "They didn't like what they were doing and that they were bringing people in"

**Post-Bombing:**
- Adams finally got family to CIA gate after suicide bombing
- State Department person running CIA gate at that point
- "Basically preventing the CIA from bringing their own people in"

**Pattern:** State Department prioritizing control over effectiveness, same with NGOs

---

## CONGRESSIONAL INACTION

### The 382,000 Signature Petition

**Action:** 382,000+ signatures collected and submitted to Congress

**Topic:** Stop funding the Taliban

**Congressional Response:** **ZERO ACTION TAKEN**

**Timeline:**
- Petition submitted
- Delivered to multiple members
- Presented to committees
- Widely publicized
- No legislative action
- No hearings
- No bills advanced
- No accountability

**Significance:**
- Demonstrates public awareness and concern
- Massive grassroots opposition
- Clear democratic mandate
- Completely ignored by elected representatives

### House Bill - Congressman Burchett

**Bill:** Stop Taliban funding

**Status:** Sitting in Senate with no sponsor

**Problem:** No senator has picked it up to shepherd through process

**House Action:** Passed or introduced (specific status unclear from reports)

**Senate Action:** None

**Reason for Failure:**
- Needs Senate sponsor
- Requires committee hearings
- Must navigate Senate procedures
- No senator willing to champion
- Sits in legislative limbo

**Result:** No progress on stopping funding despite House support

### Terrorist Designation Bill - Congresswoman Nancy Mace

**Purpose:** Designate Taliban as terrorist organization

**Status:** Dead

**What Happened:**
- Congresswoman Nancy Mace introduced bill
- Republican Congress members contacted Mace
- They opposed the designation
- Asked her to drop it
- Bill killed

**Result:**
- Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists
- Even though Taliban:
  - Killed U.S. soldiers
  - Harbors Al-Qaeda
  - Trains terrorists for U.S. attacks
  - Holds three Americans hostage
  - Executes U.S. allies
  - Violates women's rights
  - Runs terrorist training camps

**Opposition:**
- **From her own party (Republicans)**
- Not Democrats blocking it
- Republicans protecting Taliban
- Bipartisan protection of terrorist funding

**Significance:**
- If designated as terrorists, funding would be clearly illegal
- Designation would trigger automatic sanctions
- Legal designation prevents relationship
- Congress actively preventing designation

### Congressman Michael McCaul

**Position:** Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee

**Power:** Controls Afghanistan/terrorism oversight

**Actions on Taliban Funding:** None

**Recent Incident:** Public intoxication at airport

**Known Issue:** Insider trading allegations

**Pattern with Witnesses:**
- Brings witnesses for "five-minute sound clips"
- Gets testimony on record
- Takes no follow-through action
- No accountability measures
- Performance, not substance

**Examples:**
- Tyler Andrew Vargas testified on Abbey Gate
- No action taken
- Sarah Adams provided information
- No follow-up
- Multiple witnesses on Taliban funding
- No legislative action

**Assessment:**
- Most powerful position to stop funding
- Chooses not to act
- Gets political credit for "tough hearings"
- Implements no solutions
- Perfect example of congressional failure

### Insider Trading Allegations

**Context:** Multiple members of Congress

**Pattern:**
- Members receive classified intelligence briefings
- Trade stocks based on non-public information
- Make millions
- Rarely investigated
- Almost never prosecuted

**Relevance to Taliban Funding:**
- Members who know about terrorist threats
- Members who vote on defense spending
- Members who oversee intelligence
- May profit from continued conflict
- Financial incentive to maintain status quo

**Sarah Adams' Implication:**
- Some Congress members may profit from situation
- Explains lack of action
- Money more important than security
- "People make money off of it, is an incentive, people care about money more than country"

### Theory Behind Continued Funding

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**

**Possible Belief:**
Some members of Congress may believe the Haqqani Network (particularly Sirajuddin Haqqani) can be used as a conduit against Russia, particularly regarding the Ukraine war. This is the only logical explanation for the unprecedented funding levels.

**The Ruse:**
- U.S. believes it's playing Kandahari Taliban against Haqqani Network
- Reality: Both factions communicate daily via Telegram
- They coordinate all approvals and information sharing
- Present fake internal conflicts to U.S. officials
- U.S. wastes resources on non-existent political crisis
- Real issues ignored: terrorism, murders, women's apartheid

**Historical Pattern:**
- U.S. funded Taliban during Afghanistan War
- Funding continued while Taliban killed U.S. soldiers
- Same pattern continues post-withdrawal
- "Near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists"
- Everyone playing game with terrorists

**Multiple Theories (Adams):**
1. **Terror sympathizing problem** - Some genuinely support Taliban
2. **Incompetence** - Don't understand what they're doing
3. **Money laundering** - "People make money off of it, is an incentive"
4. **Politics** - "People care about politics more than country"
5. **No accountability** - "No one will be honest and say this is wrong, fix it"
6. **Partisanship** - "Well if my party is doing it, maybe it's wrong but at least it's my party"

**Adams' Warning:**
"We're in a very divided country but it's both parties doing this. They're benefiting by dividing us and we participate in it every time we allude to it or die on a hill for one of these losers representing us."

### Bipartisan Failure

**Both Parties:**
- Democrats: Started funding, maintain program
- Republicans: Block designation bills, continue funding
- Both benefit from status quo
- Both receive lobbying money
- Both avoid accountability
- Both fail American people

**Muslim Brotherhood Lobby:**
- Banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE
- NOT banned in America
- "Makes so much money lobbying"
- "Brings money to Democratic Party"
- Influences U.S. justice system
- Funding terrorist family court cases in U.S.

**Sarah Adams:** "We need to ban them in America"

## MARTYR FAMILY PAYMENTS

### U.S. Paying Taliban KIA Families

**Policy:** U.S. government paying welfare to Taliban martyr families

**Who Gets Paid:**
- Every Taliban member who died fighting U.S. forces
- Family receives stipend from U.S. government
- Ongoing monthly payments
- Funded from humanitarian aid budget

**Justification Given:**
"One person gave answer: 'It'll stop them from joining ISIS'"

**Sarah Adams' Response:**
"The Taliban guy is already dead"

### American Gold Star Families

**Gold Star Families:** American families who lost loved ones to Taliban attacks

**U.S. Support:** "Aren't getting squat"

**Comparison:**
- Taliban KIA families: Monthly stipend from U.S.
- American KIA families: Minimal support
- Enemy families treated better than American families
- U.S. funding those who killed Americans

### Logic and Irony

**The Absurdity:**
1. Taliban fighter kills Americans
2. Americans kill Taliban fighter
3. U.S. pays Taliban fighter's family
4. U.S. doesn't pay American Gold Star family
5. Justification: Prevent family from joining ISIS
6. Reality: Fighter already dead, can't join ISIS

**What It Funds:**
- Taliban recruitment ("we take care of families")
- More fighters willing to die
- Incentive structure for suicide bombers
- Family financial security if martyr
- Encourages more attacks on Americans

**Sarah Adams:** "We should not be giving a penny" to this

### Scale and Scope

**Number of Families:**
- 20 years of war
- Thousands of Taliban KIA
- Each family receiving payments
- Adds up to millions monthly
- Billions over time period

**From Weekly Plane:**
- Part of 70% siphoned to Taliban causes
- Officially "humanitarian aid"
- Actually payments to terrorist families
- Board membership requirement ensures this
- NGO infiltration facilitates this

## FUNDING ATTRIBUTION AND IRONY

### Al-Qaeda's Inside Joke

**The Message:**
- Al-Qaeda makes jokes about U.S. funding going to camps training homeland attackers
- Insider joke: "America is funding its own attack"
- Used in propaganda and recruitment
- Demonstrates U.S. weakness and foolishness

**Propaganda Angle:**
- Will portray attack as "inside job" by U.S. government
- Goal: Make Americans distrust their government
- Plays into conspiracy theories
- Makes Americans question official narratives

**Building Seven Reference:**
- Al-Qaeda found 9/11 conspiracy theories "fascinating"
- Actively studies American conspiracy communities
- Plans to incorporate conspiracy theory elements into attacks
- Goal: Make conspiracy theorists view Al-Qaeda as "revolutionaries and rebels"
- Similar to Hamas supporter dynamics among American activists

**Strategy:**
- Divide Americans against each other
- Destroy trust in government
- Make some Americans sympathize with terrorists
- Use America's own money against itself
- Perfect asymmetric warfare

### U.S. Intelligence Will Confirm ISIS

**The Setup:**
- Taliban has been feeding information to U.S. government for years
- Small pieces on individual ISIS-K terrorists
- Entering U.S. intelligence databases
- Creating paper trail

**After Attack:**
- U.S. will search databases
- Will find prior intelligence on attackers
- "Yeah we had a little piece on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers will have similar database entries
- All pointing to ISIS

**Result:**
- U.S. intelligence will confirm "It's an ISIS attack"
- Will not recognize Al-Qaeda
- Will not recognize Taliban involvement
- Will not recognize state actor involvement (Russia, Iran, China)
- Attribution completely wrong, but supported by years of planted intelligence

**Sarah Adams:** "That's how well they've planned this."

### Nobody Gets Blamed

**After Attack:**

**ISIS Gets Blamed:**
- Media reports ISIS attack
- U.S. government confirms ISIS
- Intelligence databases support ISIS
- Public believes ISIS

**Actually Responsible:**
- Al-Qaeda (planning, training, commanding)
- Taliban (camps, support, funding)
- Iran (planning, intelligence, resources)
- Russia (supply chain, support)
- China (resources, long-term support)

**None Will Be Implicated:**
- No state actor connection recognized
- No Al-Qaeda role identified
- No Taliban involvement acknowledged
- Perfect deniability for all
- Can continue same relationships

**U.S. Response Will Be:**
- Strike ISIS targets
- Ignore Al-Qaeda
- Continue funding Taliban
- Maintain relationships with Russia/China
- Completely miss actual threat

### Cost of Inaction

**October 7th Attack:**
- 1,500 Hamas attackers trained in Afghanistan
- Resulted in 1,200+ killed, thousands wounded
- Billions in economic damage
- Ongoing war costs
- Regional destabilization

**Predicted U.S. Attack:**
- 1,000+ attackers trained in Afghanistan
- Scott Mann reportedly told Shawn Ryan: 50,000-60,000 American deaths predicted

**Training Cost Per Terrorist:**
- If $60 million/year to refugee program = Al-Qaeda camps
- 1,000 U.S. attackers + 1,000 Europe + 10,000 Syria = 12,000 recent trainees
- $60 million ÷ 12,000 = $5,000 per terrorist trained
- U.S. paying $5,000 to train each terrorist who will attack America

**Prevention Cost:**
- Stop funding: $0
- Taliban designation: $0 (actually saves money)
- Congressional action: Just vote
- Total cost to prevent: $0

- Congressional mandates

**Seven of eight delivery stops are designated terrorists**

**No accountability, no prosecution, no investigation**

### Congressional Failure

**Two bills introduced: Both killed or stalled**

**Bipartisan protection of terrorist funding**

**No hearings, no accountability, no change**

### The Coming Attack

**October 7th was template:**
- Planned in Afghanistan
- Trained in Afghanistan
- Funded with U.S. money
- Israel ignored warnings
- 1,200+ killed

**U.S. homeland attack:**
- Planned in Afghanistan

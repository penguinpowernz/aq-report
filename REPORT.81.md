## 2008 Mumbai Attacks and Drone Strike Ethics

### The Mumbai Attack

**Event Details:**
- Terrorist attack by Lashkar-e-Taiba (Pakistani-based terrorist group)
- Multiple locations targeted in Mumbai (second largest city in India)
- Hotel attacks among the targets
- Killed a very large number of people
- Attack emanated from Pakistan according to Indian government

**Congressional Response:**
- Congress contacted CIA: "What are you going to do about this?"
- Pressure on CIA to respond given Pakistan operations focus
- Global War on Terror was focused on Pakistan at the time

### Pakistani Terrorist Groups

**Coverage Issues:**
- Adams was the only person covering Lashkar-e-Taiba at the time
- Pakistani terrorist groups received minimal focus
- Groups not affiliated with Al-Qaeda were deprioritized

**Priority System:**
- Al-Qaeda received primary focus
- Maybe TTP (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan)
- Maybe Taliban
- Pakistani terror groups not on the list

**Example: Ilyas Kashmiri**
- Famous terrorist who was equally bad throughout career
- Only became a target after joining Al-Qaeda
- Didn't live even a year after declaring Al-Qaeda affiliation
- Demonstrates targeting priority system

### Attempted Fraudulent Drone Strike

**The Scheme:**
- Adams' boss decided to select random terrorist camp
- Plan: Label it as Lashkar-e-Taiba to satisfy Congress
- Chose location to conduct drone strike as response to Mumbai

**The Intelligence:**
- Garbage reporting suggested terrorists at location
- Adams investigated and determined reporting was false
- Ran down information, confirmed it was not the right group
- Never were at that location

**Adams' Response:**
- Boss asked Adams to write report justifying strike with false information
- Adams refused
- Instead wrote comprehensive report explaining why every piece of information was wrong
- Submitted report on Friday before week-long training

**Alternative Action:**
- Boss went to Department of Defense detailee instead
- Believed DoD person would be more compliant than CIA personnel
- DoD person wrote up false nomination for strike
- Submitted while Adams was at offsite training

**Resolution:**
- Thursday night: Adams saw the false nomination being circulated
- Friday morning: Sent report to all leaders across four branches
- Also sent to two bosses above them
- Senior boss (famous analyst from Bin Laden raid, featured in Zero Dark 30)
- Senior boss assigned investigation
- Investigation confirmed Adams' findings
- Strike was prevented

### Career Consequences

**Retaliation:**
- Boss attempted to write up Adams
- Canceled TDY (temporary duty assignment) to war zone
- Made Adams look bad professionally
- Started write-up process for Adams
- Write-up attempt stopped after Adams received positive review from President's briefer
- Boss admitted: "I can't do it now because you got this review"
- Affected Adams' career for approximately one year
- Finally escaped from that office

**Lesson Learned:**
- Adams did not go high enough with complaint
- Only complained to immediate bosses (who did the right thing)
- Never gave information to Inspector General
- Years later discovered boss became supervisor of Yemen drone shop
- "Very dangerous" situation given willingness to lie about targeting

**Yemen Concerns:**
- Same boss who attempted false Pakistan strike supervised Yemen operations
- "A ton of drone strikes in Yemen"
- Must nominate strikes formally (not spontaneous decisions)
- Questions raised about legitimacy of strikes under her supervision
- Likely 2-3 year rotation in Yemen position

### Systemic Issues

**Promotion System:**
- Government employees promoted based on tenure, not necessarily merit
- "Even if you're good or not" people get promoted
- Creates environment where bad actors advance

**Lack of Accountability:**
- No robust HR department at CIA
- Only person guiding career is current boss
- Boss helps get next job or blocks it
- Boss helps with training courses or blocks access
- Personalities can significantly affect career trajectory
- Can get "really held back" by bad bosses

**Pattern of Irrational Actors:**
- "Every time I've seen somebody do the wrong thing there's not a logical reason"
- "A normal person wouldn't do that"
- "It's like an irrational actor"
- "How do you get to the level because you wouldn't have thought of doing it"

**Location:** Camp Chapman, Khost Province, Afghanistan
**Type:** Double agent suicide bombing
**Casualties:** Seven CIA personnel killed
**Perpetrators:** Al-Qaeda and TTP (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) joint operation

### Planning and Execution

**Original Plan:**
- Attack was planned for Peshawar, Pakistan
- People in Pakistan were planning it the entire time
- Asset chose to move location to Khost, Afghanistan at last minute
- Location change was itself a warning sign

**Target:**
- Ruse involving doctor treating Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri
- Zawahiri was deputy head of Al-Qaeda at the time
- "Number two most important terrorist in the CIA"
- "Probably the biggest operation of the time in the CIA"
- Doctor claimed medical access to Zawahiri

**Agent Background:**
- Double Jordanian agent (actually triple agent)

- Jordanians gave agent to CIA
- Agent was actually working for Al-Qaeda/TTP

**Attack Sequence:**
- Afghanistan CIA personnel joined planning at end of process
- Pakistan personnel had been planning entire time
- Agent committed suicide attack during CIA meeting
- Plan succeeded, resulting in seven CIA officer deaths

### Adams' Discovery

**Learning of Attack:**
- Adams was in another city in Pakistan at time
- Flew into office knowing nothing (secure communications protocol)
- Boss called her into office
- Adams expected to be in trouble (regular occurrence)

**Context:**
- Adams had been away for a week
- Prepared to defend herself from assumed accusation
- Boss delivered news of Camp Chapman attack

### Key Figures

**Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri:**

- Al-Qaeda never fakes eulogies
- "Very odd that they haven't eulogized him"
- "I don't think a fake one's going to come out but why isn't the real one come out"

**Current Al-Qaeda Leadership:**
- Al-Qaeda has not publicly named next leader
- Chosen de facto leader exists but unusual situation

- "Al-Qaeda uses them and joins attacks"
- TTP has been "so powerful" in recent years
- People "kind of ignore that fact"
- Joint operation demonstrated long-term cooperation

## Capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar

### Background and Significance

**Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar:**
- Co-founder of Taliban
- Number two of Taliban at time of capture (2010)
- Lead operational commander of Taliban
- Every US soldier death in Afghanistan "on his shoulders"
- Made entire peace deal that turned Afghanistan over to Taliban
- Currently in Afghan government (approximately number three position)

### Targeting and Operational Security

**Starting Point (2009):**
- Adams began targeting Baradar in 2009
- "Really good OpSec" (operational security)
- Would get on phone for only about one minute
- Very difficult target

**Institutional Skepticism:**
- Deputy Chief of Station stopped Adams in weekly meeting
- Said in front of entire station: "Sarah, why are you still briefing this? You're never going to get Mullah Baradar on a phone"
- Signals intelligence collector also didn't believe Adams' phone identifications
- Refused to collect on phones Adams identified

**Support from Maya (Bin Laden Raid Analyst):**
- Maya from Bin Laden raid defended Adams
- Told signals collector: "You need to collect. I don't give a damn what you think. We're the CIA."
- Collector still likely didn't collect
- Adams had someone in another location collecting phones independently

### The Capture Operation (January 2010)

**Initial Break:**
- Phone activated while Adams was flying to Islamabad
- Contact called: "You won't believe it, Baradar's phone is up"
- Phone had been active entire flight duration
- Highly unusual behavior - "doesn't make any sense"

**Leadership Vacuum:**
- Occurred during COSOS (Chiefs of Station) conference
- Top three leaders gone from Islamabad
- Chief of Base from Baradar's location also gone
- Only leader available: Chief of Liaison

**Attempted Authorization:**
- Adams approached Chief of Liaison for approval
- Chief of Liaison: "Let me think about it"
- Adams didn't wait for answer

**Direct Action:**
- Went directly to team operators
- Asked for two guys to go to Karachi
- Team: "We got two in Lahore, we'll move them"
- Adams booked flight to Karachi immediately
- Proceeded without formal authorization

**Location Tracking:**
- Phone active in Quetta initially
- Adams: "Let's just capture him in Quetta"
- Called Chief of Base in Quetta

**The "Eleanor" Problem:**
- Chief of Quetta had obsession with different target
- Reference to "Gone in 60 Seconds" movie
- Eleanor was the car protagonist could never get
- Quetta Chief had Tahir Shaw - deputy shadow governor for Helmand
- Shadow governor for famous Taliban commander Mullah Naim Barich
- Chief: "I don't think it's Baradar. I'm going to go for Tahir Shaw"
- "We probably should see how much money we've wasted on capturing this guy because we failed every time"

**Shaw Operation:**
- Quetta team spent first half of day pursuing Tahir Shaw
- Failed to capture Shaw (as always)
- Meanwhile Baradar's phone moved

**The Key Insight:**
- Phone moving from Quetta to Karachi
- Adams: "This is his kid. There's no way Baradar rode to another city with his phone and rode back"
- Decided to wait until phone returned home
- "We can only capture him at home because you don't want to pick some kid up at a restaurant"

**Final Capture:**
- Phone returned to exact neighborhood Adams thought Baradar lived
- Conducted capture operation
- Success: "We just got really lucky his kid stole his old phone out of the closet and brought on a trip with his dad"

**Authorization Status:**
- Top 10 Taliban pre-approved for capture
- Legal approvals already obtained
- Baradar was number two, so on approved list
- Standard process: Go to COSOS for approval
- COSOS (Chief of Station) was gone
- Number two was gone
- Number three was gone
- Number four wouldn't give answer
- Adams went to where Baradar lived
- Chief of Base there was also gone
- Replacement was Adams' friend
- Friend: "Let's do it"
- "We really got no approvals because nobody was in country"

**Approval Process for Non-Listed Targets:**
- Must go to CIA lawyers
- Can take months for approval
- Standard legal review required

### Post-Capture Complications

**Initial Identification Issues:**
- Photo sent first to CIA asset in Afghanistan
- Asset Adams considered unreliable ("correct CP")
- Asset failed to ID photo
- Everyone concluded: "It's not him"
- Adams: "No it's him. That source is crap and you need to finally fire him"
- Got photo to sources who actually knew Baradar
- Positive identification confirmed
- Problem: Many Afghan sources "fed us a bunch of garbage"
- "Got paid for it"
- Sources often "worked for three other intelligence agencies"

**Real Purpose Revealed:**
- Adams wanted him as number two Taliban
- Adams wanted him as lead operational commander
- US soldier deaths attributed to his command
- Adams viewed him as operations target

**Questions From Headquarters:**
- Questions were about Taliban reconciliation
- Not about targeting other Taliban members
- Not about ongoing operations

**The Real Plan - Taliban Reconciliation:**
- President Obama appointed special envoy
- Special Envoy: Richard Holbrooke
- Goal: Taliban reconciliation
- Assessment: Could only reconcile with Taliban using Mullah Baradar

**Interrogation Focus:**
- "Who would you be okay with coming to meet with you about peace?"
- Listed countries: "Would you be okay if Japan came, the Brits came?"
- Adams: "Oh my gosh, they only want this guy for reconciliation"

**Realization:**
- "That's when I saw we're going to make a deal with the Taliban"
- "We're going to give part of the government back to the Taliban"
- Adams: "I didn't think it was going to be what today was"
- "If I went back in time I never would have captured him because he is the reason the whole country fell"

**Immediate Takeover:**
- Day of capture: Chief brought Adams and lead debriefers to office
- Chief: "This is the number one focus in the White House"
- "They want to bring out this whole Holbrooke guy"
- "They want to take it over from Islamabad station"
- "They don't even want you guys debriefing him"

**Special Treatment:**
- Chief fought for Adams' team to debrief
- "They pulled everything"
- Sent psychiatrist to watch debriefing sessions
- Purpose: "Make sure we had rapport with him"
- "They made sure his detainee debriefers had rapport with him"
- "They were already kissing his butt right after we caught him"

### Character Assessment

**Personal Interactions:**
- "I really liked most terrorists I met" (on human-to-human level)
- "This guy was smart, he was charismatic"
- "He was probably a genius"
- Could remember exact conversations from days prior
- "He told you something like five days ago, he could remember"
- "He knew exactly when he told you stuff"
- "He could defend anything"

**Persuasive Abilities:**
- Would provide logical justifications for Taliban actions
- Adams: "Oh yeah, that actually makes sense or I see the logic"
- Could meet with US policymakers and be very persuasive
- Remember: "They didn't view the Taliban as terrorist group"
- Still viewed as "political group"
- "Even though they kidnap people, murder people, torture people, they rape women, they rape children"

### Historical Context: The Bombing That Restarted Taliban

**Post-9/11 Victory:**
- US went into Afghanistan after 9/11
- "Beat the Taliban in like 5 weeks"
- "Amazing, amazing, like raw raw USA"
- "They really kicked ass, they toppled the Taliban"
- Taliban all went home

**Baradar's Initial Response:**
- Took Mullah Omar and hid him in Waziristan
- Mullah Omar likely never left that location
- Baradar went home to his father's house
- Taliban position: "We lost, we're done"

**Bin Laden Escapes:**
- Bin Laden crossed from Tora Bora into Pakistan
- "War on Al-Qaeda was kind of over"
- US had moved "whole war machine to Afghanistan"
- "We beat the Taliban and Bin Laden's gone"

**US Decision:**
- "What are we going to do?"
- Decision: "Target the old Taliban leaders even though we just beat the Taliban"
- Made hit list of senior Taliban leaders

**The Provocation:**
- US came and bombed Baradar's house
- This occurred months after Taliban defeat
- Bombing injured Baradar's father

**Baradar's Response:**
- "Screw this, I'm going on offense"
- "You beat us and then you come back here months later and you bomb my house"
- Father's injury didn't help situation
- "That's when he triggered over and said okay, game's on, Taliban's back"
- "You didn't win"
- "That's when he went full back in"

**Adams' Reaction:**
- "When you tell he tells you that story I'm like, heck yeah, you come and bomb my dad, I'm in"
- Acknowledged justification: "He would always have a good story like that"

### Current Funding Situation

**US Aid to Taliban:**
- Approximately $40 million per week goes to Taliban
- Funding continues despite Taliban actions against US allies

**Taliban Actions Against US Allies:**
- Videos of "very very painful deaths"
- "Really bad torture deaths"
- "Some really bad beheading deaths of our allies"
- "All the guys we used to work with over there"
- Videos sent during or after deaths as taunts

**Specific Incidents at Kabul Airport:**
- US military present but couldn't respond
- Taliban taunts: "Grab a woman and shoot her in the head"
- "Burn a child alive in front of the military"
- Taliban knew US military "couldn't act"

### Outcome and Release

**Baradar's Release:**
- Eventually released from custody
- Became key US intermediary with Taliban
- Made the peace deal
- Result: Afghanistan fell to Taliban

**2021 Assessment:**
- Peace deal implementation complete
- Baradar instrumental in Taliban takeover
- Adams' regret: Would not have captured him knowing the outcome

## 2021 Afghanistan Withdrawal

### Timeline and Context

**Key Date:** July 1, 2021
- US snuck out of Bagram Air Base in middle of night
- Did not tell commander of Bagram of departure
- Commander arrived in morning
- Taliban and terrorists breaking prisoners out
- Abbey Gate bomber released from Bagram that day

**Abbey Gate Bomber Background:**
- 2017: ISIS deployed him to New Delhi, India
- Cover: Posed as engineering student
- Started college in New Delhi
- Cased multiple locations:
  - New Delhi airport
  - Shopping mall
  - Other targets

**Capture in India:**
- 2017: Indians or CIA infiltrated ISIS network
- Discovered bomber's identity
- Captured in India
- Sent to Bagram prison
- Held from 2017 until July 1, 2021

**Discovery of Bomber Identity:**
- Adams had not slept in a week
- Had just helped people into Kabul airport
- Middle of night: Received photo from Libya ISIS contact
- Photo had Arabic text
- Adams thought it was Libyan terrorist
- Translated name: "Al-Logari" (Afghan name)
- Adams: "Why are you sending me an Afghan?"
- Contact: "Look at him"
- Adams searched name - found nothing
- Finally asked: "Was he involved in the Kabul airport attack?"
- Contact confirmed yes
- Initially thought he might be planner
- "Usually you don't know the bomber, they just take some low-level guy"
- Next day: Hit the press who bomber was

**Tyler Vargas Andrews:**
- Marine who had bomber in his sights
- Part of Moral Compass Federation with Adams
- Not met in person but part of same organization
- Described witnessing atrocities

### State Department Control

**Chain of Command Issues:**
- "This was State Department run"
- Question: "Do you hear anybody ever say we need to hold State Department accountable for the horrible NEO?"
- Military position: "We were just following the State NEO rules"

**CIA Gate Takeover:**
- CIA was "probably the only real government organization moving people out"
- "Taking our allies out, making it happen and doing the right thing"
- State Department took over CIA's gate
- Reason: "They didn't like what they were doing and that they were bringing people in"

**Post-Bombing Operation:**
- Adams finally got family to CIA gate after suicide bombing
- State Department person running CIA gate at that point
- "Basically preventing the CIA from bringing their own people in"

### Government Intentions

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "I think the government just wanted to get out of Afghanistan"
- "Actually thought they were going to get away with it"
- "Just wanted to leave and be done"

**Unexpected Resistance:**
- "Never expected 20 years of veterans or Intel officers that worked in the country or even just NGOs who had supported the country were going to go back in and save their allies"
- "We got in their way, like in a bad way"

**Narrative Disruption:**
- Government plan: "We left 100 Americans behind"
- Volunteer groups compiled data across organizations
- Cross-group tally: "8,000 Americans are left behind"
- "How are you getting away with saying we only left 100 Americans behind?"
- "Actually the volunteers who at least told the truth and held the government to account"

### Afghan Evac Coalition

**Government Response:**
- Created coalition to quiet dissenting voices
- "The government's not dumb"
- Made coalition to get people to be quiet

**Task Force Pineapple:**
- Scott Mann's organization
- "One of the louder ones obviously talking about the issues"
- Government wanted to "diffuse that"

**Afghan Evac Creation:**
- "Partnership between the government and all these NGOs"
- "Of course not all of us are a part of it"
- Moral Compass Federation described as "the rogue entity to the side"
- "If I'm in something it's like the rogue entity to the side"
- Reason: "We don't want to play with this game"

**Afghan Evac Function:**
- "Just talks what State Department wants to talk"
- "Keeps people quiet"
- Must sign "tons of NDAs"
- Adams: "After the third NDA I was like what the f***, I'm out of this group"
- Purpose: "To keep the volunteer groups in line"
- "To make them mentally happy"

**Assessment:**
- "It is a cover to drag out the evac 100%"
- "All these groups just fall in line with it"
- Two years later (2023): "They still do their monthly meetings"
- "People still talk about it like it's really saving people"
- Adams initially thought: "I hope they know that they're being played"
- Two years later: Still participating

## Current Terrorist Activities

### China-Taliban Relations

**Historical Relationship (2009):**
- Mullah Baradar's job: Liaison from Taliban to Chinese government
- Would travel to China for meetings
- Maintaining relationship with Chinese government

**Chinese Priorities:**
- Primary ask: Taliban collect intelligence on Uighurs
- "Pass it to us"
- "Taliban are reporting on other Muslims to China"
- Contradiction: "Everyone acting like they're going to be some big counterterrorism force"
- "The people of China are doing abuses against [whom] the Taliban have been supporting that for a very very long time"
- "Besides what they're doing in their own country"

**Taliban Requests:**
- "Help us get weapons or funds for weapons"
- Established bilateral cooperation

**Relationship Strength:**
- "Taliban-China relationship has been stronger than the US-Taliban relationship at least since 2009 for sure"
- "Of course China would be the main party they link up with when they go to [power]"

**Current Status (2023):**
- China is first and only country with official ambassador to Taliban government
- "First and only country that has assigned an official ambassador to the Taliban government"
- Others have "weird envoys"
- "I believe that's the first designated ambassadorial position"

**Chinese Presence in Afghanistan:**
- Northern Alliance reports Chinese officials "everywhere"
- "Building massive hotels right outside of these lithium deposits"
- "Huge multi-million dollar structures"
- Unusual for Afghanistan: "In the middle of nowhere"

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Part of China's Belt and Road Initiative
- China "don't have to go make a relationship"
- "The guy they brokered with [Baradar] now I don't know what he is now, like number three in the government"
- Baradar "plays a huge part in the economics piece of this current government"
- "Already positioned to hook China up which was his closest ally before he was captured"

### Green Energy and Lithium

**Resource Connection:**
- Afghanistan has very rich lithium mines
- Lithium needed for batteries powering green energy
- Green energy comes from China
- Not energy independence
- China present in Afghanistan immediately after US pullout

**Adams' Analysis:**
- "I really hope people have known this the entire time"
- "Would blow my mind if people negotiated with the Taliban didn't know this"
- China relationship fundamental to understanding Taliban position

### Al-Qaeda Resurgence

**Lessons from Libya:**
- "Al-Qaeda has adapted"
- "They learned something I think from Benghazi"

**Strategy Evolution:**
- When Al-Qaeda went into Libya after Gaddafi:
- Decision: "Better for us to take the local commanders and make them the Al-Qaeda leaders instead of bringing in a foreigner"
- Rationale: "You bring in an Egyptian into Benghazi, it doesn't always go well because locals like, 'Oh, Egyptians'"

**New Approach:**
- "We're going to appoint the local"
- "Now Al-Qaeda is doing that in Afghanistan"
- "For each province that Al-Qaeda is making commanders for, a lot of them they're taking Taliban members and making them the Al-Qaeda commander"

**Strategic Benefits:**
1. "US will just say they're Taliban when they're Al-Qaeda"
2. "They already have the support because they're the Taliban"
3. "Not bringing in some outside force and being like 'follow me I'm Al-Qaeda'"
4. "You're already following the Taliban guy, he now works for Al-Qaeda"

**Benghazi Application:**
- "That's what they did in Benghazi"
- "The two that they chose in Benghazi were involved in our attacks"
- "They're doing it in Afghanistan now but for every province"
- "It's like a hundred Benghazis"
- "It almost feels like man, they're smart. They are. It's genius"

**Historical Friction:**
- "There's always been a little ruffling, especially you bring in Egyptians, is always the best example"
- "There's a little head butting"
- Local integration solves this problem

### Foreign Terrorist Convergence

**Why Afghanistan:**
- "It's safe because we're not there"
- No more drone strikes
- Can live much safer

**Training Camp Infrastructure:**
- Libya was supposed to become location for all training camps
- Failed in Libya
- Now shifted to Afghanistan
- Plan: At least one training camp in each province
- Train all foreign terrorists in Afghanistan
- Deploy from Afghanistan to different groups worldwide

**Key Facilitator:**
- "The terrorist who moved all of our attackers that left our attacks out of Libya after the attacks, he's sitting in Kabul"
- "Al-Qaeda's best terrorist facilitator is in Kabul"
- "That's their plan"

**High-Value Target Movement:**
- Recent case: High-value target from Libya
- Previously high-value target in Pakistan
- Now in Afghanistan
- No drone strikes, safer environment
- Supporting training camp infrastructure

### Resistance Forces

**Northern Alliance:**
- Goes back to Ahmad Shah Massoud
- Key US ally before 9/11
- Massoud assassinated

**Terrorist Connections:**
- Individual who provided two Tunisian suicide bombers to Massoud
- Same individual provided attackers to Zawahiri for Benghazi attacks
- "The guy's still in play"
- "This is still all connected"
- "Massoud's son comes up as a connection"
- "Even the same terrorists are still in the circle as when Ahmad Shah Massoud was in power"

**Resistance Message:**
- "The Northern Resistance is trying to tell that to people"
- "These are still the same attackers"
- "We're here fighting international terrorists"

**US Misinformation:**
- "A lot of misinformation in the US that what's happening in Afghanistan is a domestic war or tribal war"
- "No, those are foreign terrorists"
- "They're fighting Al-Qaeda at this point"
- "So many terrorists are pouring into Afghanistan"

**Other Resistance Pockets:**
- Tajiks (Northern Alliance, most well-known)
- Sami Sadat's group
- Special forces from real Afghan government
- Ministry of Defense members
- Various leaders
- Many are Pashtun but don't have to be
- Different pockets across Afghanistan

**Need for Unity:**
- "As we go along, all these different pockets are going to need to go under an umbrella"
- "They're going to need to unite"
- Parallel to terrorist organization: TTP formation example

### Umbrella Organization Strategy

**TTP Formation Example:**
- "Only purpose of forming TTP was to make the terrorist stronger by putting them all together"
- Combined groups:
  - Baitullah Mehsud's group
  - Abdullah Massoud
  - Mullah Dadullah
  - Qari Hussain
  - Hakimullah Mehsud
- "You all go under this structure"

**Al-Qaeda's Application:**
- "Al-Qaeda's like that's genius"
- Bin Laden: "I want to start doing that. I want to do it in Libya"
- Didn't happen when he wanted
- Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi started doing it
- Later followed Bin Laden's plan with another organization that did report to Al-Qaeda

**Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi:**
- Set up as umbrella organization
- "Any group you can join us"
- Creates confusion: "A guy at our attacks, he's Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi and he's AQIM because it's an umbrella organization"
- "You can be any terrorist group under the Ansar al-Sharia banner"

**Current Planning:**
- "Al-Qaeda is getting really smart about that"
- "Having meetings with international terrorists to discuss how can we make more of these umbrella organizations and wrap us under it"
- Haqqanis involved in discussions
- Former Gitmo terrorist in Libya having discussions with Haqqanis
- Topic: "How do we view all of this together?"
- "Don't make it Afghanistan, don't make it Libya, make this a global terrorism front"
- "Those conversations are happening"

## Capture of Younis Al-Mauritani

### Context and Timing

**Post-UBL Raid Situation:**
- After Bin Laden raid, concern about Pakistani retaliation
- CIA sent many Americans home from Pakistan
- Fear: "The Pakistanis might arrest all these Americans who were involved"
- Pakistan's response: Stopped issuing visas
- Result: "We don't have enough staff in Pakistan"

**Visa Solution:**
- Looked for personnel who still had valid visas
- Pakistan previously issued 10-year visas
- Then changed to 5-year visas
- Then changed to trip-specific visas only
- Adams had 5-year visa
- One part-time CIA officer (married to JSOC officer) had 10-year
- Maya (who caught Bin Laden) had 10-year visa

**Volunteer Response:**
- Three women volunteered to go
- Maya volunteered to return to Pakistan
- Maya was known to all of ISI as person who got Bin Laden
- Leadership concern: "They're all wigging out"
- Decision: Didn't take Maya (despite her volunteering)
- Maya described as "a little bit of a tough character"
- Female boss "didn't want to have her come back"
- Adams and other woman went instead

### Al-Mauritani's Profile

**Position:**
- Al-Qaeda external operations commander
- Equivalent role to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM)
- "10 guys died since" KSM
- "Not as smart as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who did 9/11"
- "Kind of like the C team"
- "This is now who we got"
- In charge of any external plotting for core Al-Qaeda out of Pakistan

### The Intelligence

**Movement Intelligence:**
- Information received: Al-Mauritani leaving Pakistan for Africa
- Adams' assumption: "Maybe like Libya at the time just because of the year" (2011)
- Plan: He and his cell moving out of Pakistan
- Intention: Plan attacks in Europe from Africa

### CIA-ISI Relations Crisis

**Station Atmosphere:**
- Pakistan station "like a ghost town"
- "Doing nothing, there's no work going on"
- No CIA-ISI operations ongoing
- Complete breakdown in cooperation

**Adams' Proposal:**
- Adams: "Let's go ask Pakistan to detain them"
- Response: "Everyone laughed at me"
- Station: "We don't do operations with Pakistan anymore"
- Adams: "Are we going to ask?"
- Station: "We don't even talk"

### The Tennis-Playing Chief

**Chief of Liaison Meeting:**
- Adams to Chief of Liaison: "Can you call ISI and see if we can go capture Younis real quick?"
- Chief of Liaison: "I don't talk to ISI"

**Absurd Exchange:**
- Adams: "But you're the Chief of Liaison, your only job is liaison with ISI"
- Chief: "Yeah"
- Adams: "Can I have their number?"
- Chief: "I don't have their phone number"
- Chief: "I'm only here to play tennis"

**The Tennis Racket:**
- Adams thought she misheard
- Adams: "You don't have a number? You can't call them?"
- Chief: "No"
- Chief literally grabbed tennis racket
- Left the meeting with tennis racket
- Middle of the day, went to play tennis
- During discussion about capturing external operations planner for Al-Qaeda

**Adams' Reaction:**
- "This is our US government"
- "Everybody needs to hear this"

### Finding ISI Contact

**Alternative Approach:**
- Returned to targeting shop
- Team: "How'd it go?" (making fun)
- Adams: "The jerk doesn't even have ISI's number"
- Adams: "But we do"

**The Old Notebook:**
- Old notebook kept in front of phone
- "Never got changed"
- "You probably need to go throw that notebook away"
- Adams: "The phone number is in this notebook, I know it because I've called from it"

**ISI Contact:**
- Found ISI phone number in notebook
- "The ISI the targeters talk to, not the ISI the Chief of Station talks to, but I don't care"
- Called the number
- ISI officer knew Adams
- Adams: "Hey it's Sarah Adams, I'm back in country, we want to meet"
- ISI: "Come on over"

### Negotiating with ISI

**First Meeting:**
- Adams and permanent station targeter attended
- Met in room Chief of Station normally uses
- Different from where Adams usually met ISI
- "Big room with maps all over"

**Discovery:**
- "We always printed maps for ISI and I never knew what we did with them"
- "I go to them, this is where all our maps went"
- Thought CIA had been doing operations with ISI using these maps

**Senior ISI Officer:**
- "Very senior ISI guy"
- Adams assumed: "Probably the head of the CT directorate"
- Adams had never met anyone at that director level
- Didn't know his identity

**The Negotiation:**
- Adams told them about Younis
- 4-5 terrorists traveling with Younis at the time
- ISI officer listened
- ISI: "You know, we'd be interested but we're really upset about Bin Laden"
- Went through expected complaint

**The Deal:**
- ISI: "If you handshake with me that you'll tell us if you're going to go get Ayman al-Zawahiri in Pakistan, we'll do it"
- Adams' thought process: "I just thought he would say you did this with Bin Laden and we're not going to do work with you"
- ISI asked for handshake agreement

**Adams' Response:**
- "Luckily I'm not going to just handshake people, I'm just I'm not a liar"
- Adams knew: "We were nowhere near getting Zawahiri"
- Adams: "I know we're not about to capture Zawahiri in Pakistan"
- Shook his hand
- Adams: "So funny because I had no authority to shake his hand"
- ISI: "Okay"
- Began planning operation

**Breakthrough:**
- "One meeting with ISI to get them to restart capture operations"
- "That was it"
- "The US didn't even try"
- All leadership: "Over there playing tennis"

### Additional Operations

**Al-Qaeda Karachi Leader:**
- During Younis planning meetings
- Press reported: Head of Al-Qaeda in Karachi captured
- Adams knew him well: "I used to be the Karachi targeter"
- Adams to ISI: "Can we meet him?"
- ISI: "Of course"
- Started debriefing Al-Qaeda's head of Karachi
- Opportunity arose because "luckily were meeting with ISI again"
- He was in their building

### The Capture Operation

**Movement to Southern Pakistan:**
- Younis and team went to southern Pakistan
- Plan: Get on a boat (not a ship) to Africa
- Some guys: "You got to be kidding me, this plan is crazy"
- Several terrorists abandoned mission
- Returned to Waziristan
- "Ditched Younis"

**Limited Intelligence:**
- Only information: Someone named "Dawood" would move him
- "We need a starting point in Quetta"
- No capture team available in Quetta (capture operations had stopped)

**Kabul Team Assistance:**
- Contacted Kabul
- Kabul: "I'll be your capture team"
- Kabul sent person with their tools
- Now had capture team

### The Intelligence Breakthrough

**Choosing a Target:**
- Adams: "Let's pick a Dawood"
- Selected Dawood Badini
- Profile: KSM's brother-in-law
- Released a few months prior
- Reasoning: "He's in Quetta, he's important enough to where he would facilitate him"

**Historical Intelligence:**
- Adams: "I know I saw in the past during CIA's debriefing program, people mapped out his house"
- Dug up old intelligence
- Found the house location

**Verification:**
- Asked Al-Qaeda Karachi leader they were debriefing
- Adams: "Did you know Dawood? Did you ever go to his house?"
- AQ Leader: "Yeah, I've been to his house"
- Adams: "Does his family still live there?"
- Intelligence was from 2002-2003: "That was so old"
- AQ Leader: "Yeah, he still lives there"

**Mapping Exercise:**
- Pretended not to know location
- Had AQ leader map it out
- His mapping matched exact same location as 2002-2003 intelligence

**Imagery Confirmation:**
- Got current imagery
- Set imagery in front of AQ leader
- "His eyes got all big because his description wasn't good at all"
- AQ Leader thinking: "How did they find this house from my description?"
- Description: "It was down a street and there was a school bus"
- Actually found it from decade-old intelligence

**Staging:**
- Staged at Dawood Badini's house
- Younis was three blocks away
- "I doubt that Dawood was involved, we took a guess and he was that close to the location that we were able to capture him"

**Success Factor:**
- "Long time ago CIA's amazing debriefing program that people always give a hard time about"
- "Greatest collection of counterterrorism information ever"
- "Old piece of info from 2002 or 2003 helped us do a starting point"

### Confirmation of Capture

**The Eid Verification:**
- ISI: "It's going to take us a week to get them up there"
- "It's Eid this week, you can come the week after and start detainee debriefing"
- Station: "We got to confirm they really have Younis, headquarters wants a confirmation"

**Adams' Plan:**
- "I'm just going to show up and be dumb"
- First day of Eid (Monday)
- Convinced another station targeter to join
- Plan: "Pretend we have a meeting, see if Younis is there"
- Targeter: "This is never going to work, we're going to get in so much trouble"

**The Infiltration:**
- Drove to ISI compound
- One guy in guard tower
- Guard waved them through
- Everyone off for Eid holiday
- Parked (no one around)
- Walked in main doors
- Reception area empty
- No one working

**Finding Younis:**
- Adams: "We're going down to the detainee room"
- Went to detainee debriefing room
- Room with CCTV cameras
- Turned on all TVs
- Younis appeared on TV
- Minder walked in, shut TV off

**Discovery:**
- Few minutes later, ISI officer noticed them
- ISI: "What are you guys doing here?"
- Adams: "Oh, didn't we have a meeting today?"
- ISI: "No, we told you it's next week"
- Adams: "Oh my gosh, I always get stuff confused"
- Left compound
- Reported to station: "We saw Younis on camera, he's in Islamabad"

**ISI's Deception:**
- Next week: Returned for official debriefing
- Adams asked Colonel: "What was Younis like?"
- Colonel: "I haven't spoke to him yet"
- Meaning: Minder never told him they saw Younis on camera
- ISI spent whole week debriefing Younis
- Pretended he wasn't even in the city yet

**Station Reaction:**
- "Everyone was so excited that it was really Younis"
- "He's really unique looking"
- "When we saw him on camera it was 100% him"
- "Everyone was really excited that yes we got the right guy"
- Previous nervousness: "Is ISI really going to do this?"
- "Are they going to let the guy go?"
- "Are they really going to do this operation with us?"

**Full Success:**
- Got all three targets wanted
- Younis Al-Mauritani
- His cell members
- Al-Qaeda Karachi leader bonus

### Personal Context

**The Kashmir Boyfriend:**
- Adams dated a Kashmiri for 5 years
- Result: "It was like getting a 101 into ISI"
- "By the time I got to Pakistan and I worked with ISI they were the exact same"
- "Everything they did I knew"
- "I always knew all their games"
- "I could communicate with them perfectly because I dated someone difficult just like them for five years"
- Applied relationship lessons to ISI negotiations

## Benghazi Attacks

### Government Lies - Two Big Narratives

**Narrative 1: The Fake Protest**
**Narrative 2: GRS Response Time**

### The Fake Protest Narrative

**Real-Time Knowledge:**
- No one in Libya believed there was a protest
- No one in Benghazi thought there was a protest
- Nobody in town reported a protest
- "It was a weird DC thing"
- "In country we didn't argue about a protest"
- "Nobody thought there was a protest"

**Video Evidence:**
- Two surveillance videos obtained week after attacks
- Video from State compound
- Video from CIA compound
- Videos showed no protest
- "Obviously saw there was no protest"

**Headquarters Response:**
- Called headquarters with video evidence
- Headquarters: "We're not going to change the narrative until you bring us the videos"
- Headquarters: "You need to courier them back over"
- CIA Tripoli found way to digitally send videos
- Sent videos within 24 hours
- Headquarters never changed the narrative

**Realization:**
- Adams: "That's when I realized the narrative is what they want"
- "They don't actually care if there's facts, whether there's a protest or not"

**Station Chief Response:**
- Chief of Station Tripoli agreed there was no protest
- "It's so strange, in country we didn't argue about a protest"
- "Nobody thought there was a protest"
- "We're doing our jobs, trying to find the attackers, trying to figure out who was involved"

**Dissent Cables:**
- CIA would write reports about the protest
- Chief of Station would send dissent
- "Chief of Station Tripoli does not agree with this assessment, that there was not a protest"
- "That's really all we could do from the field"
- "The field sometimes gets overruled by what headquarters thinks is the truth"

### The GRS Response Narrative

**GRS:** Global Response Staff (CIA security team)
**Team Lead:** Oz (previously on Shawn Ryan Show)
**Their role:** Went to aid Ambassador after attack

**Early Cover-Up Knowledge:**
- Adams arrived back in Tripoli after attacks
- GRS team lead "triple whispering to me"
- Meeting location: Outside
- Adams: "Okay, this is already a hush-hush thing"
- Team lead told Adams information
- Adams: "I already had the indication that the CIA was going to cover that piece up"

**Government Narrative:**
- Claimed GRS responded immediately
- This was false

### Justice (or Lack Thereof)

**Limited Accountability:**
- "There's been a little bit of justice"
- Some attackers killed in US drone strikes

**Drone Strike Details:**
- One attacker targeted for who he was
- But: Not targeted for Benghazi connection
- Targeted for ISIS affiliation instead
- Other attackers: "They targeted the wrong group or they got lucky and got our guy"

**French Actions:**
- French killed top three North African Al-Qaeda members from attacks
- "We got a little bit of justice from them"

**Libyan National Army:**
- Killed the mastermind of CIA Annex piece of attack
- Killed in mortar strike
- Adams: "The good part is he was killed in a mortar strike"
- "We kind of appreciate that"
- "Eye for an eye, right?"
- "There's no other way you could have taken him out honestly"

### The Obama Administration's Role

**President's Actions:**
- Obama got on plane to Las Vegas during attack
- Going to see Beyoncé and Jay-Z
- Question: "Why did he not cancel that trip and stay and make sure his orders are followed up on?"
- "Obama flew to Vegas while the attacks were happening"
- State Department and CIA annex under attack
- President flying to Vegas for entertainment

**The Video Narrative:**
- Narrative: Anti-Islam movie sparked protests
- Los Angeles Times reported: Producer of anti-Islam movie behind bars
- Nakoula Nakoula arrested Thursday
- Jake Sullivan created the video narrative
- "Then they all jumped on board"
- Obama made statement
- Hillary Clinton made statement

### Terrorist Connections

**Ahmad Shah Massoud's Assassination:**
- Key US ally before 9/11
- Assassinated by two Tunisian suicide bombers
- Individual who provided the Tunisian suicide bombers to Massoud
- Same individual provided attackers to Zawahiri for Benghazi attacks
- "The guy's still in play"

**Continuity:**
- "This is still all connected"
- "Even the same terrorists are still in the circle"
- People want to "ignore that"
- "They want to make Benghazi this little thing on the side that randomly happened"
- "When it's a piece of the whole pie"
- "They want to compartmentalize everything"

### Quote from Interview

"People are so lost that it is this big thing and it's all connected right. They want to ignore that and they want to make Benghazi this little thing on the side that randomly happened when it's a piece of the whole pie. They want to compartmentalize everything."

## Border Security and Terrorist Infiltration

### Confirmed Terrorist Border Crossings

**Adams' Knowledge:**
- "I know that because I was told several different times about pockets of terrorists"
- Multiple groups with different sizes
- Multiple terrorist organizations involved

### Specific Groups Identified

**Group 1: ISIS (8 members)**
- 8 ISIS terrorists
- Procured visas from Afghan government
- Sole purpose: Coming to US southern border
- Route: Iran → Turkey → Turkey → Brazilian visa → Darien Gap

**Group 2: Haqqani Network (25-50 members)**
- Adams uncertain if 25 or 50 total
- Haqqani Network affiliation
- Haqqani Network runs Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)
- All got passports through ministry connections
- Route: Turkey → Brazil → Darien Gap

**Group 3: Al-Qaeda**
- Al-Qaeda has also sent attackers
- Same routes as other groups
- Specific numbers not provided

### The Route

**Key Countries:**
1. **Afghanistan:** Procurement of passports
2. **Iran:** Transit point (for ISIS group)
3. **Turkey:** Transit point
4. **Brazil:** Destination for visa
5. **Darien Gap (Panama):** Crossing point to continue north

**Why Brazil:**
- "Easy to get a humanitarian Brazil visa"
- "No real security to stop you from leaving"
- "Then you just now go illegally up through the Darien Gap"

### The Darien Gap

**Location:** Panama
**Significance:** "Your choke point where they're all going through"

**Dangers:**
- Murders
- Rapes
- Robberies
- Animal attacks (example: large wild cats, cougars)
- Diseases
- Panamanian authorities (torture and abuse upon capture)

**Survival Rate:**
- "If 10 Afghans go in, maybe six come out"
- "Super dangerous"
- Adams knows someone who reported: "Afghan died by a large wild cat"

**Environment:**
- Jungle terrain
- Extreme poverty in region
- "Kind of a real wild wild west"
- "So many criminals going through it"

**Who's Traveling Through:**
- "That's where everybody's targeting to travel through"
- Not just terrorists, but massive human migration
- Criminal elements
- Vulnerable populations

### Detection and Apprehension

**Known Captures:**
- Adams: "I wouldn't imagine it's very many"
- "It seems like the southern border is pretty wide open"
- "Last year I thought there was like 20 in a month or something"
- "Maybe in this year it was like 100 or so"
- "I don't know the exact number"

**The Detection Problem:**
- "We're missing a lot"
- "These are only who we've caught"
- "Who we have biometric for"
- Question: "If we don't have their biometrics in our system, how do we know they're terrorists?"
- "We don't even know who they are"

**Passport Issues:**
- Fake Taliban passports
- Don't contain biometrics US had anyway
- Don't have the name on watch list
- Might not even have correct ethnicity
- Example: Pakistani using Afghan Taliban passport
- US assumes they're Afghan
- Completely wrong identity

**Detention Status:**
- Captured individuals "are in detention facilities"
- Adams assumes interrogations occurring
- "I just don't have access to that"

**Debriefing Information:**
- Adams: "I have not seen any debriefings"
- "Luckily I have not known a terrorist that's come over, thank heavens"
- No access to motivations or intelligence from captures

### Visa Procurement Methods

**Taliban Government Passports:**
- Taliban government issuing passports to non-Afghans
- "Sole purpose of coming to our southern border"
- Systematic process
- Multiple groups using same method

**Ministry Control:**
- Haqqani Network runs Ministry of Interior
- Direct access to passport issuance
- Ability to provide documentation to large groups

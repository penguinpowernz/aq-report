# DRILLDOWN: Key Takeaways from Al-Qaeda Intelligence Reports

**Source Material:** Shawn Ryan Show Episodes 81, 81-2, 116, 149 featuring Sarah Adams
**Time Period Covered:** October 2023 - December 2024
**Classification:** Open Source Intelligence Analysis
**Analyst:** Sarah Adams, Former CIA Counterterrorism Officer

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This intelligence assessment, compiled from four extensive podcast interviews with former CIA counterterrorism officer Sarah Adams, reveals an imminent and existential threat to the United States homeland. Al-Qaeda, operating under the leadership of Hamza bin Laden (alive and contrary to U.S. government claims), has reconstituted to strength levels exceeding pre-9/11 capabilities. The organization has trained and deployed approximately 1,000 terrorists specifically for attacks within the United States, with an additional 1,000 trained for coordinated European operations. The U.S. government continues to fund the Taliban with $44-87 million per week, money that directly supports Al-Qaeda training camps and operations. State and local law enforcement are receiving zero threat information from federal agencies. The planned attacks, modeled on the October 7th Hamas assault and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, are expected in 2025.

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The U.S. government is actively suppressing intelligence about these threats, has falsely claimed key terrorist leaders are dead, and is deliberately avoiding collection on known terrorist locations in Afghanistan.

## IMMEDIATE THREATS

### 1. Homeland Attack - 2025 Timeline

**Force Composition:**
- **1,000+ trained terrorists** deployed for U.S. homeland attack
- **Mixed force:** Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters (ISIS will claim responsibility for attribution confusion)
- **Training completed:** All attackers have finished training and are deployed
- **Entry methods:** Southern border (primary) and legal visa/refugee pipelines

**Attack Methodology - Mumbai Model:**
- **Swarming attacks** on multiple cities simultaneously
- **Real-time intelligence** feeding to attackers during operations
- **Fedayeen fighters:** Will fight to the death, not surrender
- **Extended duration:** Multi-day engagements, not hit-and-run
- **Operational flexibility:** Attackers authorized to change targets in real-time
- **Secondary attacks:** Bombers timed to hit first responders

**Target Categories:**
- **Symbolic:** U.S. Capitol (specifically in Al-Qaeda propaganda since 9/11), national monuments, government buildings
- **Economic:** Bridges, metro systems, transportation hubs, infrastructure
- **Mass casualty:** Universities, churches, stadiums, schools, shopping centers, farmers markets

**Innovations That Make This Different:**
1. **"Invisible bomb vest"** technology (December 2023)
   - Defeats magnetometers and explosive-sniffing dogs
   - Can enter buildings undetected
   - Demonstrated by Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula
   - TSA has taken no countermeasures

2. **Fedayeen fighters new to U.S. context**
   - Americans have never experienced sustained fedayeen attacks
   - First responders untrained for this threat
   - Apparent surrender may be deception leading to detonation

3. **Intelligence pre-planting**
   - Taliban feeding U.S. databases with ISIS fighter information for years
   - After attack, U.S. will confirm "ISIS" from existing database entries
   - Attribution will be completely wrong but supported by years of planted intelligence

**Casualty Estimates:**
- Scott Mann reportedly predicted 50,000-60,000 American deaths
- Adams confirms scale of planning supports massive casualties

**Timing:**
- **Adams' assessment:** "I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both"
- **Caveat:** October 7th was planned for 2022, executed 2023 (one-year delay)
- If doesn't happen in 2025, doesn't mean wrong - could be delayed
- **Risk:** People will let guard down if attack doesn't occur on expected timeline

### 2. European Attacks - Parallel Operations

**Force Composition:**
- **1,000 trained terrorists** deployed specifically for European operations
- **Separate training and deployment** from U.S. homeland force
- **Coordination:** May be simultaneous with U.S. attacks or sequential

**Target Focus:**
- October 7th-style coordinated attacks
- Embassy attacks
- Mass casualty locations
- Paris Olympics propaganda already released

### 3. Embassy Attacks - Three Categories

**Middle East Embassies:**
- **U.S. Embassy Baghdad:** Specifically identified as target
- Purpose: Push U.S. out of region for caliphate expansion

**African Embassies:**
- **U.S. Embassy Bamako, Mali:** Under specific threat
- Multiple other African locations (some details withheld)
- **Abu Muhammad al-Masri** (head of Al-Qaeda in Africa, thought dead but alive) is reason for Mali threat
- Purpose: Push U.S. out for caliphate expansion

**European Embassies:**
- Target U.S. for Middle East involvement
- Coordinated with broader European attacks

**Pentagon Response:**
When Adams warned embassy personnel in Africa directly, Pentagon sent "nasty gram" complaining about not using "formal channels" - showed zero concern for actual threat or personnel safety.

### 4. Advanced Weaponry and Technology

**Dirty Bomb Research:**
- **Location:** Chinese-owned uranium mines in southern Afghanistan (at least two provinces)
- **Participants:** Al-Qaeda, Iranian IRGC, Chinese personnel
- **Collaboration:** "Same building" - all three working together
- **IRGC role:** Helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- **Purpose:** Not nuclear weapons ("not exactly") - dirty bomb specifically mentioned
- **Access:** Afghanistan has significant uranium deposits beyond lithium

**Invisible Bomb Vest:**
- Defeats standard security measures
- Technology demonstrated publicly December 2023
- Video quickly removed but technology retained
- Allows suicide bombers to enter buildings, not just remain outside
- Most U.S. buildings completely unprepared

### 5. Training Camp Infrastructure

**Scale:**
- **30 Al-Qaeda training camps** in Afghanistan
- **7 camps:** Exclusive suicide bomber training
- **23 camps:** General training (advanced urban warfare, cover operations)
- **Goal:** One training center in every Afghan province

**Training Curriculum:**
- Advanced urban warfare (professional military-level)
- Suicide bombing techniques
- Cover and covert operations (operational security, fake identities)
- Physical endurance and weapons proficiency
- Operational security: Trainees don't know each other's real names

**Camp Capacity:**
- **October 7th:** 1,500 Hamas fighters trained (originally planned 500 in 2 months)
- **Syria deployment:** 10,000 fighters trained (recently completed)
- **U.S. homeland:** 1,000 fighters (training complete, deployed)
- **Europe:** 1,000 fighters (training complete, deployed)
- **Islamic Army total:** 120,000 trained overall

**Funding Source:**
- U.S. "humanitarian aid" to Taliban: $5 million per month specifically
- Delivered by Abdulaziz Haqqani to camps
- Claimed purpose: Afghan refugee resettlement
- Actual use: Training terrorists for U.S. homeland attacks

## CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE GAPS

### 1. Hamza bin Laden - The Suppressed Truth

**Official U.S. Position:**
- Listed as deceased (claimed killed 2019)
- $1 million reward (absurdly low for overall Al-Qaeda leader)

**Reality:**
- **Alive and in Afghanistan** (confirmed September 2023)
- **Overall leader of Al-Qaeda** and Islamic Army
- **September 2021:** Person who got information out that Hamza is alive was "captured, tortured, and killed by Taliban"

**CIA Suppression Campaign:**
- **CIA actively instructed U.S. press not to print stories about Hamza being alive**
- British Intelligence leaked information to press (frustrated with CIA suppression)
- British intelligence contacted Adams: Information is accurate
- British press covered extensively (Mirror, Sun, others)
- Indian and African press covered
- **U.S. press still won't publish** - defer to CIA

**Why the Lie:**
- 2010: State Department planned Taliban reconciliation
- One thing could stop peace deal: If it benefits the Bin Ladens
- Any U.S. leader at 9/11 memorial "never going to make a deal with Al-Qaeda"
- **Critical fact:** Hamza married daughter of Mullah Omar (Taliban founder)
- Therefore: U.S. peace deal with Taliban was also peace deal with Bin Ladens
- Next heir to Al-Qaeda is grandson of both Osama bin Laden AND Mullah Omar

**Hamza's Leadership Style (Different from Father):**
1. **Covert operations:** No videos, no audio, wants "hidden hand"
2. **Speed:** Approves operations in single meeting (father took 5 years for 9/11)
3. **Timeline:** Wants everything in his lifetime, not 1,000 years
4. **Philosophy:** "Take it to America on U.S. soil" - primary goal

### 2. Mohammad Kazemi - Missing Most Wanted

**Position:**
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization (Iran)
- One of most senior intelligence officials in Iran

**Activities:**
- Close friend and colleague of Qasem Soleimani (killed January 2020)
- Soleimani tasked him: Keep Al-Qaeda leaders safe
- Protected Hamza bin Laden and Saif al-Adel in Iran
- **Co-planner of October 7th Hamas attacks**
- **Mastermind of Soleimani assassination revenge plot** (detailed below)
- Travels regularly to Afghanistan
- Coordinates with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Hamas, IRGC

**Intelligence Failure:**
- **Not on FBI Most Wanted List**
- Despite being mastermind of major terrorist attacks
- Despite coordinating ongoing operations against U.S.
- One of most important terrorist facilitators globally

### 3. Released Gitmo Detainees - Zero Collection

**The Failure:**
- "We haven't even collected on what happened to the Gitmo guys released"
- Adams recently found Gitmo detainee involved in Benghazi
- He's "talking to Kenyans" - no U.S. collection
- **When in Gitmo: Files didn't even identify him as Al-Qaeda**
- **Reality: He was Al-Qaeda when captured and put in Gitmo**
- **Current: Has been terrorist for 11 years since release**
- U.S. government doesn't know he was involved in Benghazi

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "Think of it: We haven't even collected on what happened to the Gitmo guys released. Can you imagine what we're doing to anybody else?"
- **"We're not collecting on these guys"**
- **"I have no idea if we're even collecting traffic anymore"**

### 4. State/Local Law Enforcement - No Threat Information

**Governor Ron DeSantis Statement:**
After being briefed by Sarah Adams and Scott Mann:
- **"I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from the federal government"**
- Zero federal information sharing to state level

**Florida's Response (Day After Briefing):**
- Briefed every sheriff in State of Florida
- Created information sharing mechanism
- Direct line between Adams' team and Governor's office
- Can contact DeSantis immediately with threat information

**National Problem:**
- If Florida (third largest state) receiving zero information
- All other states likely in same position
- First responders unprepared for October 7th-style tactics
- No training for fedayeen fighters
- Cannot prepare defenses against known threats

### 5. Known Terrorists in Afghanistan - No Action

**Hamza al-Darwi:**
- Top al-Qaeda target for many years
- Sanctioned by U.S.
- Ran electronics workshop for Bin Laden
- Close personal friend of Bin Laden
- Involved in Benghazi attacks
- **Currently in Afghanistan training terrorists**
- **Adams provided location to U.S. government - no action taken**
- **"He's there training terrorist to come attack United States. They're not doing anything about it."**

**Ibrahim al-Banna:**
- Main AQAP (Yemen) commander
- U.S. thought he was dead
- **Actually in Afghanistan**
- **"Guess who he hangs out with? Hamza bin Laden"**
- Being completely ignored

**The Count - Million Dollar Bounties:**
- Adams metric: People with $1 million+ bounties
- "$1 million, $5 million or $10 million bounty and they're in Afghanistan right now"
- **"I'd say there's 15 of them"**
- Not Taliban - Al-Qaeda or other very known terrorist groups

**Adams' Regular Experience:**
- Regularly provides terrorist locations to U.S. government
- Response: **"I really just get 'thanks for your info.' Nothing happens."**
- One year ago: Provided "really good" intelligence
- "Went up to the White House level"
- **"They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"**

**Why No Action:**
- **Adams:** "Because they want you to believe al-Qaeda does not exist in Afghanistan"
- **"So how can you kill an al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan?"**
- Strategy: "They want us to forget about Afghanistan and move on"
- **Source:** "I've heard this from congressmen"
- Probability of this assessment: **"100%"**

## SYSTEMIC FAILURES

### 1. U.S. Funding Taliban - $44-87 Million Weekly

**Weekly Cash Deliveries:**
- **Public reports:** $40 million per week
- **Actual range:** $44-87 million per week (large discrepancy)
- **Duration:** Continuous since Kabul fall (2021-present)
- **Source:** U.S. State Department via NGOs

**Distribution of Funds:**

**Eight Delivery Stops (Weekly):**

1. **Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund**
   - Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. law)
   - Has cancer, goes to Pakistan for treatment
   - Heavy investments in Pakistan

2. **Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar**
   - Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. law)
   - Made deal with Iran to send Al-Qaeda to attack U.S./Israeli troops
   - Huge Doha deal violation
   - Negotiated the peace deal that gave Afghanistan to Taliban

3. **GDI - Abdul Haq Wasiq**
   - Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. law)
   - Runs Taliban CIA
   - Released for Bowe Bergdahl exchange
   - **Holds three Americans hostage** (two in same cell, third separately)

4. **Ministry of Interior - Sirajuddin Haqqani**
   - Designated terrorist (delivery violates U.S. law)
   - Sent 1,500+ suicide bombers at U.S./NATO troops
   - Where document forger makes passports for terrorists
   - Uses biometrics left behind to hunt U.S. allies

5. **Sirajuddin Haqqani's Personal Residence**
   - Direct cash delivery to his house
   - **"U.S. is dropping cash off at his house weekly"**

6. **Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada**
   - Taliban religious leader
   - Gets stipends from Iranians, Russians, Indians
   - Controls $10 billion Chinese investment money
   - **U.S. pays approximately $3 million per month** (nearly his entire office budget)

7. **Al-Qaeda Military Commission - Saif al-Adel**
   - Runs Al-Qaeda military commission
   - De facto head of Al-Qaeda external operations
   - Planning attacks against U.S.
   - U.S. government lies and says he's head of Al-Qaeda
   - Receives weekly U.S. cash deliveries

8. **The Top Three of Al-Qaeda - Bin Laden Brothers:**
   - **Hamza bin Laden** (Overall leader) - Designated terrorist
   - **Saad bin Laden** (Deputy) - Designated terrorist
   - **Abdullah bin Laden** (Business operations/COO) - NOT designated
   - All receive U.S. cash deliveries from airplane

**Additional Funding Streams:**

**Taliban Political Office in Qatar:**
- At least $10 million per month in operating expenses
- Funded by U.S. since 2013
- **11+ years of continuous funding**

**Refugee Program (Al-Qaeda Camps):**
- $5 million per month
- Run by Khalil Haqqani
- Claimed purpose: Resettling Afghan refugees
- Actual use: Abdulaziz Haqqani delivers directly to Al-Qaeda training camps
- Camps contain Libyan fighters and foreign nationals training for U.S. attacks

**Summary:**
- **"Every single delivery except one was a building, every single one of those terrorists are sanctioned, every delivery is against U.S. law"**
- **"U.S. paying weekly the head of Al-Qaeda"**

### 2. Congressional Inaction - Total Failure

**Petition Results:**
- 382,000+ signatures collected
- Submitted to Congress
- **Result: Zero action taken**

**House Bill (Congressman Burchett):**
- Introduced to stop Taliban funding
- **Status:** Sitting in Senate with no sponsor
- No senator has picked it up

**Terrorist Designation Bill (Congresswoman Nancy Mace):**
- Purpose: Designate Taliban as terrorist organization
- **Status:** Dead
- **Opposition:** Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose
- **Result:** Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists

**Chairman Michael McCaul (House Foreign Affairs Committee):**
- Recent: Public intoxication at airport
- Known: Insider trading allegations
- Action on Taliban funding: **None**
- Pattern: Five-minute sound clips with witnesses, no follow-through
- Tyler Andrew Vargas testimony: No action
- Others testimony: No accountability measures

**Adams' Assessment of Congress:**
- "Congress doesn't have a lot of teeth"
- "They write great reports" but "what's it do?"
- "Never actually go make the threats or force people to make the change"
- "Congress holds all the money but they never actually" use leverage

**Theory Behind Continued Funding:**
Some in Congress believe Haqqani Network can be used against Russia re: Ukraine war. This is only logical explanation for unprecedented funding levels.

**The Ruse:**
- U.S. believes it's playing Kandahari Taliban against Haqqani Network
- Reality: Both factions communicate daily via Telegram
- They coordinate all approvals and information sharing
- Present fake internal conflicts to U.S. officials
- U.S. wastes resources on non-existent political crisis
- Real issues ignored: terrorism, murders, women's apartheid

### 3. CIA Not Pursuing Benghazi Attackers

**The Elevator Moment (Month 3, Benghazi Committee):**
- Adams encountered analyst at CIA
- "In the shop that should be working Benghazi"
- "He was good. One of the best analysts I knew in the agency"

**The Conversation:**
- Analyst: "What are you working on now?"
- Adams: "The Benghazi committee"
- Analyst: **"I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole"**

**Adams' Realization:**
- Best analyst, great integrity, hard worker
- In shop that would be working Benghazi
- **"Won't touch it, they're not doing it"**

**Phone Call to Boon:**
- **"The CIA is not going after the Benghazi attackers"**
- Boon: "What are you talking about? It's been a few years. They must be."
- Adams: **"No. That's why we haven't seen anything. They're not going after them."**
- **"That's the day we decided to do our own investigation and track them down ourselves"**

**Current Status - 12 Years Later:**
- Most attackers still at large
- Many in Afghanistan (15 high-value targets with million dollar+ bounties)
- Some in Libya, protected by U.S.-aligned government
- CIA analyst's "10-foot pole" statement still accurate
- **No apparent CIA operations to find or capture attackers**

### 4. Pentagon Interference With Open-Source Intelligence

**December 2024 Incident:**
- Adams identified threats against U.S. embassy in Africa
- Reached out directly to:
  - The Ambassador
  - RSO (Regional Security Officer)
- Pentagon sent "nasty gram" complaining about not using "formal channels"

**Pentagon's Priorities:**
- Only concerned that Adams provided information directly
- No interest in:
  - The actual threat
  - Safety of embassy personnel (including DOD personnel)
  - Source information
  - Intelligence details
  - Collaboration

**Adams' Assessment:**
Pentagon prioritizes bureaucratic protocols over personnel safety and fails to recognize or act on legitimate threat intelligence from open-source channels.

### 5. Intelligence Community Suppressing Facts

**Hamza bin Laden Suppression:**
- CIA actively instructed U.S. press not to publish stories
- British Intelligence leaked (frustrated with suppression)
- Foreign press covered extensively
- U.S. press still won't publish

**The NSA Report Scandal (Benghazi):**
- NSA wrote report on Benghazi attacks
- **Cut and pasted comment from press** (not intelligence collection)
- Stated "At 5:00 PM there were protests in Benghazi"
- **Two problems:**
  1. There was NOTHING at 5:00 PM in Benghazi
  2. The 5:00 PM timeframe was from Cairo, not Benghazi
- Despite being from press reports, marked **Top Secret SCI**
- Analysts elevated it as highest level classified intelligence
- Policy makers read it as "top secret evidence that there was a protest"
- False information became premium intelligence

**Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan:**
- Government wants Americans to believe Al-Qaeda doesn't exist there
- Can't kill Al-Qaeda members if "officially" they're not there
- Strategy: Make Americans forget Afghanistan and move on
- Congressmen explicitly stated this to Adams

**ISIS-K Narrative Inflation:**
- U.S. press "trying to say Taliban are a counterterrorism partner"
- Strategy: **"Talking up ISIS-K in Afghanistan to make ISIS the threat so you ignore the Taliban's working with al-Qaeda"**
- **Reality:** "Al-Qaeda is the bigger threat in Afghanistan than ISIS"
- **U.S. government position:** "ISIS is a bigger threat than al-Qaeda"
- **Adams:** "That's super frustrating because it's actually not a fact"

### 6. Biometrics Left Behind - Hunting U.S. Allies

**What U.S. Left:**
- Complete biometric database
- Location: Ministry of Interior building (now run by Sirajuddin Haqqani)

**Taliban Strategy:**
- Taken property, homes, businesses, land from U.S. allies
- Cut power (some cut 2 years ago, refuse to restore)
- Example: Police officer had power cut, Taliban won't restore, "they want to put power back on his house"

**Initial Year:**
- Taliban didn't really have biometrics working
- Faked it (like theme park fake fingerprint reader)

**Chinese and Iranian Help:**
- Got system working
- Deployed on mobile devices
- At border crossings and checkpoints

**Current Deployment:**
- Fully running for at least 6 months (as of June 2024)

**Databases Working:**
- Entire passport database
- Entire criminal database
- Entire police system for Ministry of Interior and Afghan Army
- Entire pay system for NDS (Afghan CIA)
- Entire pay system for Supreme Court

**Targeting Method:**
- Using pay systems to find allies
- "They know they have right guy because it's tied back to their damn payroll"
- "Can change your name but doesn't matter - they'll take your fingerprint and say 'we know exactly who you are'"

**Warning:**
- **"If you went through border crossing 6 months after fall and you were fine, don't assume you're fine now"**
- System didn't work then, does now

**Casualties (First 2.5 Years):**
- **10,000+ U.S. allies killed**
  - Context: Under 2,500 Americans died in 20+ years of war
- **30,000 captured**
  - 18,000 went through Taliban Sharia Court (prison or execution)
  - **12,000 completely missing**

**Secret Prisons:**
- GDI has secret prisons
- Ministry of Interior has secret prisons
- Ministry of Defense has secret prisons
- Secret prison in Bagram base
- Secret prison in Helmand
- **Total missing Afghans: 70,000** (including non-allies)

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "Greatest case of targeting I've ever seen"
- "They're doing it successfully, they're allowed to, they're getting away with it"
- "These guys don't have a chance. We left them for the slaughter."

### 7. Women - Apartheid and Violence

**Reported Rapes (last 2.5 years):**
- 880,000 women
- 15,000 children
- **Note:** These are people capable of reporting
- Most are "prisoners in their own house and can't even get out"

**Torture Videos:**
- Taliban sending to Americans

**Parliamentary Representation:**
- When Afghanistan fell: **27% women in Parliament**
- United States: 29%
- "Got to a point in 20 years equal par to us"
- Current status: Zero rights, living in prison

**U.S. Promise vs. U.S. Action:**
- Promise: "You're going to be doctors and lawyers"
- Action: **"We are doing nothing for their women, just like we did nothing for women of Iran"**
- "Against all human rights thoughts like you could even imagine"

---

## STRATEGIC CONCERNS

### 1. Al-Qaeda Larger Than Pre-9/11

**Pre-9/11 Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan:**
- "Had little pockets of training"
- "Tarnak Farms down in Kandahar"
- "Sarobi camp outside of Kabul"
- "Little pockets in Afghanistan"

**Current Afghanistan:**
- **30 training camps** (7 suicide bomber, 23 general)
- **"Training center in every province being built in Afghanistan"**
- **"The level isn't even... the al-Qaeda that is coming is so much bigger than the al-Qaeda on 9/11"**
- **"They're already probably bigger than 9/11"**

**Scale Assessment:**
- **120,000 people trained** under Islamic Army umbrella
- **100,000 new Al-Qaeda recruits** expected by end of year
- **ISIS (all locations):** ~20,000 members total
- **Al-Qaeda now five times larger than ISIS and growing**

**Training Sophistication:**
- Professional military-level tactics
- Taliban training video "scared the shit out of me" - Shawn Ryan
- Al-Qaeda training considered even higher level than Taliban
- **"Remember their life is they train all the time. If that's all you're doing all day long I mean you're going to get really competent in it"**

**Progress Assessment:**
- "We're not even... we have no progress on al-Qaeda at this point"
- **"Now we have ISIS, we have al-Qaeda which is just massing incredible amounts of people and we're Enemy Number One"**

### 2. Islamic Army - Unified Sunni/Shia Front

**Formation:**
- Created in last two years under Hamza bin Laden's leadership
- Fulfills Osama bin Laden's original vision
- Now operational reality, not just aspiration
- **Most significant development in global terrorism structure**

**Composition (Breaking Sectarian Divide):**
- **Sunni AND Shia groups working together**
- Al-Qaeda
- ISIS (including ISIS Khorasan Province)
- Taliban
- Hamas
- Hezbollah
- Iranian IRGC elements
- Any group willing to join

**Command Structure:**
- **Overall Leader:** Hamza bin Laden
- **Military Commander:** Hamza al-Ghamdi
  - Former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden
  - Appointed by Hamza bin Laden
  - Has higher FBI reward ($5 million) than his superior Hamza ($1 million)

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Confuses intelligence collection
- Prevents accurate attribution of attacks
- Protects safe havens by avoiding direct responsibility
- Allows proxy operations through different groups
- Creates unprecedented coordination

**Operational Examples:**
- **October 7th:** Al-Qaeda + Taliban + Iran IRGC + Hamas
- **Syria:** Al-Qaeda 10,000 fighters + Taliban training + HTS execution
- **Lebanon:** Al-Qaeda/Hezbollah joint plot (only Hezbollah claims)
- **Hidden Hand:** Groups won't claim responsibility for Hamza's operations

### 3. Afghanistan as Terrorist Safe Haven

**Current Status:**
- **"Afghanistan is a year away from that [Libya power level] in Afghanistan"**
- Libya timeline: End of 2011 to 2014 = sufficient strength to:
  - Kill 8,000 soldiers (2014-2017)
  - Kill 20,000 civilians (2014-2017)
- Afghanistan on same trajectory

**Why It's Safe:**
- **"It's safe because we're not there"**
- No more drone strikes
- Can live much safer
- No apparent U.S. collection or operations
- State actor support (Iran, Russia, China, North Korea)

**Infrastructure:**
- One training center per province (goal)
- Train all foreign terrorists in Afghanistan
- Deploy from Afghanistan to different groups worldwide
- Al-Qaeda's best terrorist facilitator in Kabul
- Document forger (Musa) making passports for all external operatives

**Libya Failed Model:**
- Libya was supposed to become location for all training camps
- Failed in Libya due to General Haftar's war
- Now shifted to Afghanistan

**Taliban Protection:**
- **GDI 12th Department:**
  - Sole job: Protect Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan
  - Protect all 30 training camps
  - Vet all new recruits
  - Move trainees and senior leadership
  - Harbor senior leadership in their own houses (knows U.S. won't strike GDI)
  - Protect Al-Qaeda cash holdings (very large)
  - Control all border movements for Al-Qaeda

**Foreign Terrorist Convergence:**
- Libyans, Syrians, Egyptians, Yemenis, Saudis, Pakistanis
- All going to Afghanistan
- "Because now it is al-Qaeda's hub"
- High-value targets from Libya and Pakistan now in Afghanistan
- **"There is no lack of bodies. There's no lack of terrorist volunteering."**

### 4. State Actor Support - Near-Peer Adversaries

**Iran - Most Deeply Embedded:**

**Historical Safe Haven:**
- Post-9/11: Senior Al-Qaeda leaders fled to Iran and Pakistan
- Most chose Iran (safer than Pakistan after U.S. started paying Pakistan to capture terrorists)
- Lived there with wives and children for years
- Developed close relationships with Iranian government

**Qasem Soleimani's Role:**
- Head of Quds Force (killed January 2020)
- Personally oversaw Al-Qaeda protection
- Created infrastructure to harbor terrorists
- Tasked Mohammad Kazemi: Keep Al-Qaeda leaders safe

**Mohammad Kazemi's Current Role:**
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
- Still coordinating with Al-Qaeda
- Co-plotter of October 7th Hamas attacks
- Travels regularly to Afghanistan
- Coordinates with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Hamas

**Intelligence Sharing:**
- 100% confirmed intelligence sharing Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian government has intelligence base inside Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Co-mingled operations

**Visitors to Kandahar:**
Regular meetings with Taliban AND each other:
- Iranians (IRGC)
- Russians
- Chinese
- North Koreans

**Operational Coordination:**
- October 7th planning: Al-Qaeda + Taliban + Iran IRGC + Hamas + Iranian internal military units
- Hibatullah Akhundzada (Taliban) issued fatwa for attack
- IRGC general gave final "go" order
- Deep coordination across Sunni-Shia divide

**Russia - Tactical Support:**

**Ukraine War Connection:**
- October 7th planning began March 2022 (after Russia invaded Ukraine)
- Terrorists contacted Russia: Is timing okay?
- Russia: **"Go for it, go for it, go for it"** - wanted attack to divert from Ukraine
- When attack delayed to 2023: Russia pushed "do it in 2022, don't wait, I need pressure off me for Ukraine"

**Current U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- Information suggests **Russian pipeline helping bring supplies into U.S.**
- Supplies for Al-Qaeda homeland attack
- Moving through Russian channels into United States

**Strategy:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- Use terrorists as proxies against U.S.
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS, not Russia
- No obvious Russian connection
- **"Very smart of them"**

**ISIS-K Manipulation:**
- Russia working with Taliban against one ISIS-K branch
- Taliban protecting different ISIS-K branch (Kohistani) that actually threatens Russia
- Taliban making Russia focus on wrong threat
- **"We're in near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists"**

**China - Long-term Strategic:**

**Relationship Timeline:**
- **2009:** Mullah Baradar's job was liaison to Chinese government
- Would travel to China for meetings
- Taliban reported on Uighurs to China ("Taliban are reporting on other Muslims to China")
- **"Taliban-China relationship has been stronger than the US-Taliban relationship at least since 2009"**

**Current Presence:**
- China first and only country with official ambassador to Taliban government
- Northern Alliance reports Chinese officials "everywhere"
- Building massive hotels near lithium deposits
- "Huge multi-million dollar structures in the middle of nowhere"

**Belt and Road Initiative:**
- Part of China's infrastructure strategy
- Baradar plays huge part in economics of current Afghan government
- Already positioned to hook China up (was his closest ally before capture)

**Uranium Mines:**
- Afghanistan has significant uranium deposits (beyond lithium)
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"
- **Chinese personnel + Al-Qaeda operatives + IRGC representatives**
- **"Same building" - all three working together**
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- Dirty bomb research and development

**Long-term View:**
- China viewing terrorists as potential proxies
- If U.S.-China war occurs, China will likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Longer game than Russia
- Building relationships and capabilities now
- $10 billion investment in Afghanistan
- **"$3 of every $10 gets allocated to Al-Qaeda" = $3 billion to Al-Qaeda**

**North Korea:**
- Present in Kandahar
- Meetings with Taliban and others
- Part of broader anti-U.S. coordination
- Specific activities less detailed

**Combined Assessment:**
- **"To them, they beat us"**
- Al-Qaeda and Taliban seen as power players
- **"People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country"**
- Adversaries treating Taliban/Al-Qaeda with respect
- **"What can you do for me, what can I do for you"**

### 5. Southern Border Vulnerability

**Primary Entry Route:**
- **"I think the southern border is the easiest place to come through"**
- Through Darien Gap (Panama)
- Up through South/Central America
- Across U.S. southern border

**Refugee Pipeline (Alternative):**
- **"But if they can get in a refugee pipeline they can come straight in"**
- Afghan passport now "extremely powerful"
- "Afghans are being brought in all over the world"
- Al-Qaeda: "holy crap" at opportunity

**Fake Documents:**
- Afghan passports (easiest to get from Taliban)
- Syrian passports
- Turkish passports
- Taliban issuing official passports with fake names
- **"It's the exact same thing the Taliban's doing"** as Libya did

**Border Agent Problem:**
- Most haven't been overseas
- Can't identify fake documents
- Can't identify wrong nationalities
- Example: Egyptian with Syrian passport - will agent know?
- "Passport says Syrian" - passes through

**Testing Vulnerabilities:**
- **"There are some still doing the border to actually even just to see if they can do it and test it"**
- Purpose: **"To learn about our weaknesses"**
- **"They are going to find our weaknesses"**
- **"Our southern border is probably our biggest weakness right now"**

**Legal Entry (Preferred Method):**
- "Clean" terrorists from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan
- Apply for legitimate tourist/travel visas
- Goal: **"Embarrass system again like 9/11 attackers"**
- Can fly directly to U.S.
- Legal status means less scrutiny
- Can wait indefinitely without raising suspicion

**Timeline Examples:**
- Fastest: Afghan leaving Afghanistan to U.S. border in 3 weeks
- Legal visa route: Can fly day after visa approved
- Depends on method and passport used

**Confirmed Terrorist Border Crossings:**

**Group 1 - ISIS (8 members):**
- Procured visas from Afghan government
- Sole purpose: Coming to U.S. southern border
- Route: Iran → Turkey → Brazil → Darien Gap

**Group 2 - Haqqani Network (25-50 members):**
- Adams uncertain if 25 or 50 total
- All got passports through Ministry of Interior connections
- Route: Turkey → Brazil → Darien Gap

**Group 3 - Al-Qaeda:**
- Also sent attackers
- Same routes
- Specific numbers not provided

**The Reality:**
- **"These are only who we've caught"**
- Detection problem: "We're missing a lot"
- **"If we don't have their biometrics in our system, how do we know they're terrorists?"**
- **"We don't even know who they are"**

## PATTERNS

### 1. Pay-to-Play in Government

**Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State:**
- Traveled country to country meeting with leaders
- **"In her case you had to donate money to her foundation to meet with her"**
- Foreign donors who gave to Clinton Foundation got meetings

**Consequences:**
- **"Some of our military commanders couldn't get time with her"**
- People who should have had access as part of official U.S. government business were blocked
- CIA thought she'd meet with certain people - she didn't

**The Server:**
- Evidence of economic and financial dealings in Libya
- Records of pay-to-play arrangements globally
- "All those other things as she traveled around"
- **31,000-32,000 emails deleted**
- **"That's what got wiped. That info."**
- "It's gone" - no agency can prosecute

### 2. "Fuck Up, Move Up" - Promotion System

**Bob (CIA Chief of Base, Benghazi):**
- First deployment: Eastern Afghanistan - got asset killed, sent home
- Second deployment: Benghazi - lied to GRS team, delayed response 17 minutes
- Result: **"Given the most senior award in the CIA"**
- Last known position: **Trainer at the farm**
- Teaching next generation of CIA officers

**Yemen Drone Shop Boss:**
- Attempted to nominate false drone strike in Pakistan
- Wanted to label random camp as Lashkar-e-Taiba to satisfy Congress
- Adams stopped false strike
- Boss retaliated: Canceled Adams' TDY, attempted write-up
- Result: **Became supervisor of Yemen drone shop**
- **"Ton of drone strikes in Yemen"** under her supervision
- Questions about legitimacy of all strikes under her command

**Pattern Throughout Government:**
- "Government employees promoted based on tenure, not necessarily merit"
- **"Even if you're good or not" people get promoted**
- Creates environment where bad actors advance
- No robust HR at CIA
- Boss can help or block career, training, assignments

### 3. False Narratives for Political Cover

**Benghazi Video Lie:**
- Jake Sullivan created false narrative about anti-Islam video
- Video went viral September 13 (two days AFTER attack) only because of policymakers
- Obama and Hillary Clinton knew in real time it was al-Qaeda
- Hillary sent email to daughter: It was al-Qaeda
- Publicly pushed video narrative anyway

**NSA Elevation of Press Reports:**
- Cut and pasted from press
- Marked Top Secret SCI
- False information became premium intelligence
- Policy makers treated as legitimate collection

**Hamza bin Laden "Dead" Narrative:**
- Reported killed 2019
- Actually alive (confirmed September 2023)
- CIA suppressing truth
- British Intelligence leaked (frustrated)
- U.S. press still won't publish
- Purpose: Protect peace deal with Taliban (who are married to Bin Ladens)

**Al-Qaeda "Doesn't Exist in Afghanistan":**
- Government position to make Americans forget
- Can't kill Al-Qaeda members if officially not there
- Allows them to train 1,000 terrorists for U.S. attacks
- Congressmen explicitly told Adams this is strategy

**Taliban "Counterterrorism Partner" Narrative:**
- Talking up ISIS-K to make ISIS the threat
- Reality: Al-Qaeda bigger threat than ISIS in Afghanistan
- Purpose: Ignore Taliban working with Al-Qaeda
- Justify continued funding

### 4. Ignoring Field Intelligence

**The Elevator Moment:**
- Best CIA analyst working Benghazi desk
- "I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole"
- CIA not pursuing Benghazi attackers
- 12 years later: Still not pursuing

**Adams' Regular Experience:**
- Provides terrorist locations to government
- Response: "Thanks for your info" - nothing happens
- One year ago: Intelligence went to White House level
- "They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"

**Hamza al-Darwi Example:**
- Top target for years, sanctioned by U.S.
- Adams provided location to U.S. government
- "He's there training terrorist to come attack United States"
- "They're not doing anything about it"

**15 High-Value Targets in Afghanistan:**
- People with $1 million+ bounties
- "$1 million, $5 million or $10 million bounty"
- All in Afghanistan right now
- Al-Qaeda or very known terrorist groups (not Taliban)
- No apparent operations to capture or kill

**October 7th Warning Parallel:**
- People observed Hamas terrorists training in Afghanistan
- Reports provided to Israeli government before attack
- Israel knew "Hamas was planning some big plot" in Afghanistan
- No action taken
- October 7th happened

**Current U.S. Situation:**
- **"Same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious"**
- **"I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake"**

**European Intelligence Confirmation:**
- European intelligence service contacted Adams through intermediary
- Message: **"Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."**
- Foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question: Does U.S. government have it and not preparing America?

### 5. Protecting Taliban While Attacking U.S. Allies

**U.S. Ally in Libya:**
- Government U.S. is aligned with
- Same side as al-Qaeda
- Harbors 75% of at-large Benghazi attackers
- Released captured terrorist Ziyad Belam in July 2023

**Ziyad Belam Case:**
- Al-Qaeda, senior member at Benghazi attacks
- Turkish authorities captured him July 2023 at Istanbul airport
- Planned to deport to Benghazi (where he's wanted)
- Prime Minister of U.S.-aligned government intervened
- Told Turks: "Send him to Tripoli" (to release him)
- Held 10 days, released July 2023
- **Stole CIA weapon night of attacks**

**General Haftar Situation:**
- Fought terrorists 2014-2017 in Benghazi
- Killed actual Benghazi attackers
- War statistics: 8,000 terrorist soldiers killed, 20,000 civilians died
- **U.S. not aligned with him**
- Terrorist families using U.S. courts against him
- War crimes claims for legitimate counterterrorism operations
- Enabled by not banning Muslim Brotherhood

**Afghanistan Allies:**
- 10,000+ killed in first 2.5 years (more than all U.S. deaths in 20 years of war)
- 30,000 captured (18,000 through Sharia court, 12,000 missing)
- Total missing: 70,000 Afghans
- Biometrics left behind being used to hunt them
- U.S. funding their hunters with $44-87 million weekly
- Videos of torture sent to Americans
- **"We left them for the slaughter"**

**U.S. Martyr Payments:**
- U.S. paying welfare to Taliban martyr families
- Every Taliban member who died fighting U.S. forces
- U.S. government paying stipend to family
- American Gold Star families "aren't getting squat"

**Justification:**
- "One person gave answer: 'It'll stop them from joining ISIS'"
- Adams: "The Taliban guy is already dead"

### 6. Muslim Brotherhood Infiltration

**Status in Other Countries:**
- Banned in Egypt
- Banned in Saudi Arabia
- Banned in United Arab Emirates
- **NOT banned in America**

**Operations in U.S.:**
- Makes money lobbying (brings money to Democratic Party)
- Influencing U.S. justice system
- Funding terrorist family court cases in U.S.

**Three Brothers Example:**
1. **Brother One:** Surgeon in Virginia
   - Runs Libyan-American organizations
   - State Department relationships
   - Muslim Brotherhood cover

2. **Brother Two:** Libyan Ambassador (politician)

3. **Brother Three:** Al-Qaeda facilitator in Europe
   - Brings injured fighters from Turkey to Bosnia for medical care
   - 2016: Brought Benghazi attacker Jabril al-Azli and 9 others
   - Adams posted on LinkedIn with names and passports
   - **LinkedIn took down post**

**Why It Matters:**
- Provides legal and financial support to terrorist activities
- Manipulation of U.S. court system
- Protection for terrorist operations
- **"We need to ban them in America"** - Adams

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS

### Current Threat Level Assessment

**Al-Qaeda's Position:**
- Larger than pre-9/11
- 30 training camps vs. "little pockets" in 2001
- 120,000 trained under Islamic Army
- 100,000 new recruits expected by end of year
- Five times larger than ISIS
- Safe haven in Afghanistan with state actor support

**Imminent Attack:**
- 1,000+ trained terrorists deployed for U.S. homeland
- Training completed, attackers deployed
- 2025 timeline (with caveat about possible delay)
- **"I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both"**

**Why We're Vulnerable:**
- No preparation by federal government
- State/local law enforcement uninformed (zero threat information)
- First responders untrained for these tactics
- Public completely unaware
- Open borders allowing entry
- Visa system allowing legal entry
- Southern border "probably our biggest weakness right now"

**Why U.S. is Al-Qaeda's #1 Target:**
- **"We're their top enemy and it always will be. It's never going to change"**
- **"Remember we killed their family"**
- Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen - killed terrorist family members
- **"There is a lot of revenge"**
- Terrorists locked up for 20 years in "really shitty prison"
- **"There are terrorists very, very upset and they want revenge"**

### Probability of Successful Attack

**Why Attack Will Likely Succeed:**

1. **Training and Preparation:**
   - Professional military-level training
   - "If that's all you're doing all day long you're going to get really competent"
   - Advanced urban warfare, suicide bombing, covert operations
   - Multi-year planning and coordination

2. **State Actor Support:**
   - Iran: Intelligence, coordination, planning, uranium access
   - Russia: Supply chains into U.S., Ukraine war motivation
   - China: Resources, uranium mines, long-term positioning
   - North Korea: Present and coordinating

3. **U.S. Vulnerabilities:**
   - No federal warning to states/local law enforcement
   - First responders never experienced fedayeen fighters
   - First responders never experienced sustained suicide bombing
   - Public completely unaware
   - Invisible bomb vest defeats security measures
   - Most buildings unprepared

4. **Deliberate Non-Response:**
   - Government wants Americans to forget Afghanistan
   - "They really think this is just going to go away" - Adams heard from congressmen
   - Known terrorists in Afghanistan - no action
   - Intelligence to White House - "decided they didn't want to do anything with it"

5. **Attribution Deception:**
   - ISIS fighters included specifically for wrong attribution
   - ISIS will claim responsibility
   - Years of planted intelligence in U.S. databases
   - After attack: U.S. will confirm "ISIS" from database
   - **"That's how well they've planned this"**
   - No recognition of Al-Qaeda, Taliban, or state actor involvement

6. **October 7th Parallel:**
   - Same planning structure
   - Same training methods
   - Same attack style
   - Israel had warnings, took no action
   - U.S. receiving same warnings, taking no action
   - **"We're making the same mistake"**

**What Makes Attack Different:**
- Multiple innovations new to U.S.
- Scale unprecedented
- Sophistication beyond previous attacks
- State-level support
- Multi-year preparation
- Strategic deception pre-planned

**Adams' Assessment:**
- **"Do they want to do something at that level? Yes"**
- **"Do I think that they will do something more innovative than 9/11? Definitely"**
- **"I think the next attack will probably be something more innovative"**
- **"They want to do something spectacular"**
- Casualty count won't matter as much as showing they can do it
- **"They want to hit here and they want to show they can do it"**

### Potential Casualty Estimates

**Scott Mann's Report:**
- Al-Qaeda predicting 50,000-60,000 American deaths
- Adams confirms scale of planning supports massive casualties

**Context for Scale:**
- October 7th: 1,400-1,500 attackers in concentrated area
- U.S. attack: 1,000+ attackers across multiple cities
- Extended duration (multi-day engagements)
- Fedayeen fighters (fight to death)
- Secondary attacks on first responders
- Invisible bomb vests allowing building access
- Swarming attacks overwhelming response

**The Reality:**
- **"I don't think it's going to be 3,000 [deaths] but I don't think it's going to matter if it's 3,000"**
- Focus is on spectacular nature, showing capability
- Economic damage will be massive
- Psychological impact will be lasting
- Attribution will be wrong, allowing continued operations

### Recommendations for Citizens

**Individual Preparedness:**
1. Understand fedayeen fighter concept - they will not surrender
2. Secondary attacks standard - first attack brings first responders, second attack hits responders
3. Apparent surrender may be deception
4. Extended engagements lasting days, not hours
5. Multiple simultaneous locations

**Family Planning:**
1. Emergency communications plan
2. Evacuation routes from major cities
3. Safe meeting locations
4. Supplies for multi-day incident
5. Understanding attack won't be "over" quickly

**Awareness:**
1. Large gatherings = soft targets
2. Transportation hubs vulnerable
3. Economic targets (bridges, metros)
4. Symbolic locations (Capitol specifically mentioned)
5. Universities, churches, stadiums, schools, shopping areas

**Community Level:**
1. Florida model: Direct information sharing outside federal system
2. State governors requesting briefings from independent analysts
3. Sheriff departments receiving direct threat information
4. Not relying on federal government for warnings

**The Reality Check:**
Adams emphasizes:
- **"Americans don't understand this"**
- **"Al-Qaeda knows this"**
- **"We have not had a man walk up to a building with a suicide vest on in the United States"**
- Fedayeen: **"We haven't had fedayeen attackers"** in U.S.
- Secondary attacks: Americans don't understand this is standard tactic
- **"We can't let our guards down"**

### Recommendations for Officials

**State Level (Florida Model):**
1. Request direct briefings from independent terrorism analysts
2. Establish information sharing mechanisms outside federal channels
3. Brief all sheriffs on potential threats
4. Create direct communication lines with intelligence sources
5. Don't wait for federal government

**Congressional:**
1. Stop Taliban funding immediately (multiple bills pending)
2. Designate Taliban as terrorist organization (bill dead, needs revival)
3. Release classified annexes of Doha deal
4. Hold hearings with teeth (actual consequences)
5. Use budget leverage to force intelligence community action

**Intelligence Community:**
1. Acknowledge Al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan
2. Resume collection on released Gitmo detainees
3. Act on intelligence provided by field sources (Adams providing locations - no action)
4. Stop suppressing Hamza bin Laden truth
5. Put Mohammad Kazemi on FBI Most Wanted List
6. Resume operations against Benghazi attackers

**Military:**
1. Prepare for mass casualty response
2. Train for fedayeen tactics
3. Prepare for multi-day, multi-location engagements
4. Understand invisible bomb vest technology
5. Secondary attack protocols

**Law Enforcement:**
1. Train for Mumbai-style attacks
2. Understand fedayeen fighter concept (will not surrender)
3. Prepare for multi-day engagements
4. Secondary attack awareness
5. Real-time intelligence during attacks (attackers will have)

**First Responders:**
1. Secondary attack protocols mandatory
2. Extended engagement preparation
3. Don't assume surrender is genuine
4. Understand invisible bomb vest technology
5. Coordinate across multiple simultaneous locations

**Border Security:**
1. Understand Afghan passport now "extremely powerful"
2. Terrorist testing vulnerabilities - document and respond
3. Train agents on fake document identification
4. Coordinate with international partners
5. Legal visa system also being exploited

**What Won't Happen (Based on Pattern):**
Based on 12 years of Benghazi investigation and current Afghanistan situation:
- Federal government won't warn
- CIA won't pursue attackers before or after
- False narrative will be created (ISIS, not Al-Qaeda)
- Years of investigation will focus on scapegoats
- Real planners will remain in Afghanistan
- Congress will hold hearings with no consequences
- "Fuck up, move up" promotions will continue

**What Might Work:**
- Independent state-level preparation (Florida model)
- Direct information sharing outside federal channels
- Citizens understanding threat and preparing
- Not relying on federal government for warning or protection
- Recognizing pattern from October 7th and Benghazi

### The Bottom Line

**Adams' Core Message:**
- **"We're not collecting on these guys"**
- **"I have no idea if we're even collecting traffic anymore"**
- **"They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"** (about White House-level intelligence)
- **"Because they want you to believe al-Qaeda does not exist in Afghanistan"**
- **"They want us to forget about Afghanistan and move on"**

**The Volunteers:**
- **"The only reason Afghanistan hasn't gone away is all these pesky volunteers like me, like Scott [Mann], whomever, still trying to save their Afghans"**
- **"We've gotten in their way and they're sick of it"**
- **"We're like annoying them at this point"**

**Why There's Still Hope:**
- **"There's a lot of good Americans who've spent 20 years working counterterrorism"**
- **"Who are trying to get the word out: Focus on this threat, make this a priority"**
- **"When they're not getting answers, they might work in parts of the government, they're going and collecting it themselves"**
- **"They are trying to do something"**
- **"We're not going to let this happen. Not on my watch"**

**The Afghan Resistance:**
- **"The resistance aren't naive. They are the experts. They know their enemy"**
- Need to build powerful coalition
- Must bring all ethnic groups together
- Can win but need unity
- Need Western support (not happening currently)

**Most Important Action:**
What Afghan resistance says unanimously:
- **"Every single person I talked to in the resistance all had the exact same answer: Stop the U.S. money going to the Taliban. Period."**

---

## CONCLUSION

The intelligence presented across these four interviews reveals an imminent, existential threat to the United States homeland that is being systematically ignored and suppressed by the federal government. Al-Qaeda, under the living leadership of Hamza bin Laden, has achieved operational strength exceeding pre-9/11 levels, trained and deployed 1,000+ terrorists specifically for U.S. homeland attacks, developed new technologies and tactics, and secured support from near-peer adversary states (Iran, Russia, China, North Korea).

The U.S. government's response has been to:
1. Fund the enemy ($44-87 million weekly to Taliban/Al-Qaeda)
2. Suppress intelligence about threats (Hamza alive, 15 high-value targets in Afghanistan)
3. Provide zero threat information to state/local law enforcement
4. Actively avoid collection on known terrorists
5. Create false narratives (Al-Qaeda doesn't exist in Afghanistan, ISIS is the threat)
6. Ignore warnings (same pattern as October 7th)

State and local officials, first responders, and citizens have been left completely unprepared for attacks using tactics, technologies, and scale unprecedented in U.S. history. The window for prevention has likely closed - training is complete, attackers are deployed, and the timeline is 2025.

The only factors providing any hope are independent state-level preparation (Florida model), veteran volunteers continuing to sound alarms despite government hostility, and informed citizens refusing to rely on federal protection. The pattern from Benghazi (12 years of non-pursuit) and current Afghanistan policy suggests that even after attacks occur, the government will create false attribution (ISIS), prosecute scapegoats, and continue funding the actual perpetrators.

**For the record:** This assessment is based entirely on open-source intelligence provided by a former CIA counterterrorism officer with direct knowledge, extensive source networks, and a 12-year track record of accuracy. The question is not whether the intelligence is credible, but whether Americans and their state/local officials will act on it while there is still time to prepare.

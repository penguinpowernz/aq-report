# DRILLDOWN: Organizational Hierarchies and Command Structures of Global Terrorist Networks

**Analysis Date:** December 15, 2025
**Sources:** REPORT.116.md, REPORT.149.md, REPORT.81.md, REPORT.81-2.md
**Subject:** Complete mapping of terrorist organizational hierarchies, command relationships, and the "Islamic Army" unified structure

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the complete organizational hierarchies of global terrorist networks based on extensive investigations by Sarah Adams (former CIA counterterrorism officer) and team. The key finding is the creation of the **"Islamic Army"** - an unprecedented unified command structure integrating Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian IRGC under the leadership of Hamza bin Laden. This represents the fulfillment of Osama bin Laden's original vision and marks the most significant evolution in global terrorism organization since 9/11.

**Key Developments:**

1. **Islamic Army Formation** (2022-2024): Approximately 120,000 fighters trained under unified command structure
2. **Sunni-Shia Integration**: Historical sectarian divide overcome for operational purposes
3. **State Actor Support**: Direct coordination with Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea
4. **Multigenerational Planning**: Training camps now incorporating families and children for long-term capability
5. **Command Structure Evolution**: New "hidden hand" operational model with plausible deniability
6. **Wave-Based Operations**: Coordinated attacks (October 7th, embassy targets, European cities, U.S. homeland)

- Part of Fat War plan
- Nobody realizes it's Afghan Taliban doing attacks

**Commander: Abdul Haq Wasiq**
- **Receives**: U.S. weekly cash deliveries
- **Status**: Designated terrorist
- **Background**: Released in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl
- **Runs**: Taliban CIA (GDI)
- **Current Crimes**: Holding THREE Americans hostage

   - No adequate food or nutrition
   - Organs breaking down, brain affected

2. **Second American** (name not public)

   - Helped British detainee stay alive before release
   - Suffering severe health consequences

3. **Third American** (name not public)
   - Held separately by GDI
   - Existence not publicized by State Department

**State Department Position**: Told families "don't say publicly, we're going to negotiate"

**Reality**: U.S. paying weekly to organization holding Americans "locked in their basement"

**GDI Department Structure**:

#### "Immigrants Department"
- **Sole Function**: Funds and supports Pakistani Taliban (TTP)
- TTP doing all Pakistan attacks now (800 attacks last year)
- GDI unit just supports them
- Part of Fat War plan

#### 12th Department - "Most Important"
- **Sole Job**: Protect Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan

**12th Department Responsibilities**:
1. Protect all 30 Al-Qaeda training camps
2. Vet all new recruits (Afghan, Jordanian, Syrian, Egyptian) before training

7. Control all border movements for Al-Qaeda

**One unit in GDI, sole job: supporting Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan**

**U.S. Relationship**: Weekly payments to GDI to supposedly hunt ISIS

**Taliban Split Reality**:
- ISIS-KP mostly attacks Kandahari Taliban side
- Only maybe one attack "near building Sirajuddin worked in" (questionable)
- ISIS-KP not attacking all Taliban, only one faction
- Taliban keeps ISIS active to keep U.S. "ISIS dollars" flowing in

### Fat War Plan

**Architect**: Hibatullah Akhundzada

**Participants**:
- Bin Ladens
- Taliban
- Al-Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent
- JUI political party in Pakistan
- Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HuM)

**HuM Connection**:
- **Fazal Rahman Khalil**: Founded Hizb-ul-Mujahideen
- Gave religious teaching to Hibatullah when young
- Still close friends with Hibatullah
- Receives U.S. money (given by Hibatullah for HuM madrassas)
- Part of Fat War plan

**Kashmir Strategy**:
- India using Taliban networks to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan
- 18 targeted for assassination (Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, HuM)
- **Key**: Not one from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen
- **Theory**: Taliban and HuM working together
- Using India to eliminate Kashmir militants aligned to Pakistan
- Pakistan loyalists can't be used in Fat War plan
- New generation of Kashmir militants fought with Taliban in Afghanistan
- More aligned to Taliban and Al-Qaeda than Pakistani military
- Creating new Kashmir landscape for future war plan

### Coordination Between Factions

**The Ruse**:
- U.S. believes it's playing Kandahari Taliban against Haqqani Network
- **Reality**: Both factions communicate daily via Telegram
- Coordinate all approvals and information sharing
- Present fake internal conflicts to U.S. officials
- U.S. wastes resources on non-existent political crisis
- Real issues ignored: terrorism, murders, women's apartheid

**Why It Works**:
- Taliban knows U.S. wants to believe there's exploitable division
- Presents fake conflicts about women's education, etc.
- Both sides get funding from U.S.
- Coordination happens behind scenes
- U.S. sees what it wants to see

---

## Haqqani Network

## ISIS and ISIS-K Structure

### Real ISIS (Iraq/Syria) - Relocated

**2020 Movement**:
- Sent 200 people to test Beluchistan, Pakistan (Panjgur area)
- Declared safe
- Began moving all senior ISIS leadership
- Now: All ISIS committees based in Panjgur

**Strategic Location** (Baluchistan, Pakistan - Panjgur):
1. Access to sea through Beluchistan
2. Balochi people very supportive about attacks on Iran
3. ISIS wanted to focus more on Iran
4. Balochi in that area have Iranian, Pakistani, AND Afghan citizenship
   - Can move freely between three countries
   - Run all routes in area
   - Unlike others who would be restricted

**Current Status**:
- All ISIS committees based in Panjgur:
  - Shura committee
  - Operational committee
  - Leadership committee
  - Media committee
- **De Facto Head**: Sanullah Ghafari (the Haqqani plant) now effectively leads all real ISIS
- Syria/Iraq: Approximately 5,000 ISIS fighters remain
- Many now are new Al-Qaeda trainees coming in

**Iran Strike Attempt**:
- Early 2024: Iran struck Panjgur trying to hit ISIS (response to Qasem Soleimani memorial bombing)
- Missed ISIS
- Hit another compound
- Publicly claimed targeting "Jaish al-Adl" to cover missed strike

### ISIS Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) - Dual Branch Structure

**Common Misunderstanding**: Most people don't know ISIS-K has TWO separate branches with different origins, leadership, and backers.

#### Branch One: Sanaullah's Branch (Pakistan-Focused)

**Leadership**:
- **Current**: Sanaullah (aka Sa'ad, Sultan Aziz Azam)
- **Previous**: Amjad Farooqi (Pakistani, captured) - actual founder Osama Farooqi now in prison
- **Significance**: Sanaullah first Afghan to lead this branch

**Origins**:
- Emanated from Pakistani fighters
- Rawalpindi agency recruits
- FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas) region
- Punjabis
- Always led by Pakistani until Sanaullah

**Sanaullah's Background**:
- **Member of Haqqani Network since 2012**
- **Was head of Haqqani Network in Kabul**
- **Demonstrates**: This branch effectively controlled by Sirajuddin Haqqani

**Size**: Approximately 7,000 fighters (2022 number, likely higher now)

**Original Composition**:
- 70% from Afghan Taliban and Pakistani Taliban (TTP)
- 15-20% Central Asians (Tajiks, etc.)

**Major Operations**:
- Abbey Gate bombing (joint ISIS-K/Haqqani operation)
- Moscow attacks
- Coordinated attacks in Kabul region

**Public Perception Problem**:
- Moscow attack had four Tajiks
- People concluded "it's a Tajik organization"
- **Reality**: Run by Afghan (Sanullah grew up in Kabul)
- Taliban and Al-Qaeda worried about Russia, started spinning propaganda: "ISIS-KP is Tajik organization, Central Asian organization, not Afghan"

#### Branch Two: Kohistani's Branch (Central Asia-Focused)

**Leader: Ghulam Kohistani**

**Background**:
- Former Tajikistan Special Forces commander
- Defected to ISIS
- Became ISIS's Minister of War
- Death was faked
- Released after Kabul fell
- Now runs northern Afghanistan ISIS operations

**Base**: Northern Afghanistan (different from Branch One's operations)

**Focus**:
- Central Asian terrorist recruitment
- Threats against Russia
- **One of Russia's main global enemies**

**Backing**:
- Supported by Sirajuddin Haqqani
- Given refuge in northern Afghanistan
- Funded by Haqqani Network

**Recruitment**:
- Gets many Central Asian fighters
- Uzbeks, Tajiks, other Central Asians
- Different ethnic composition than Branch One

**Russian Relationship Deception**:
- Real threat to Russia comes from Kohistani (Branch Two)
- Taliban hiding Kohistani's role from Russia
- Making Russia focus on Branch One (Moscow attacks)
- **Taliban protecting actual threat while appearing to help Russia**
- Russia has to work with Taliban to collect on ISIS (like U.S. does)
- Russia unaware Taliban funding and protecting branch threatening them
- Sirajuddin Haqqani controlling both branches but Russia thinks they're independent

### ISIS-KP Headquarters and Infrastructure

**Branch One Headquarters**: Kunar Province, Afghanistan

**Training Camps**: All ISIS-K training camps located in Pakistan

**Largest Camp**: Turbat, Pakistan (Baluchistan)
- Named Rozi (after hometown of ISIS-KP founder Osama Farooqi)
- **Protected by Pakistan's Frontier Corps** (branch of Pakistani military)
- Frontier Corps equivalent to National Guard moved to border

**Frontier Corps Problem**:
- Provides security at embassies in Pakistan (around embassy enclave)
- Now infiltrated by ISIS-K
- Harboring ISIS-K
- Working with ISIS-KP
- **Huge insider threat concern** for protecting Americans and foreigners in Pakistan

**Pakistan Operations**:
- Most ISIS presence in Pakistan, not Afghanistan
- Very "hush hush"
- Only one strike on ISIS in Pakistan ever - by Iran (early 2024 attempt on Panjgur)

### ISIS-Taliban Relationship

**Official**: Taliban GDI (Taliban CIA) supposed to hunt ISIS with U.S. funding

**Reality**: **Only goes after ISIS if ISIS impacts Taliban**

**Taliban Split Targeting**:
- ISIS-KP mostly attacks Kandahari Taliban side (Hibatullah, Mullah Yaqub, Mullah Baradar)
- Only maybe one attack "near building Sirajuddin worked in" - questionable if actually targeting Haqqani
- Nuance: ISIS-KP not attacking all Taliban, only one faction

**Why Taliban Keeps ISIS Active**:
- Need ISIS to remain threat
- Keeps U.S. "ISIS dollars" flowing in
- As long as ISIS is threat, Taliban continues receiving payment to fight them

### March 2020 ISIS-KP Leadership Raid

**Event**: ISIS-KP Shura meeting in Kandahar raided by Commando, Sami Sadat

**Captured**:
- 38 people arrested
- All senior ISIS-KP leadership
- Four Russian women (Adams notes: "only white people who come to Quetta are Russian prostitutes" - terrorists bringing prostitutes while claiming to stone women for adultery)

**Previous Leader**: Osama Farooqi
- Founded ISIS-KP
- Pakistani
- Came from Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
- Now in prison

**Result**: After leadership captured, ISIS-KP deferred to Sanullah (had most fighters under him in Kabul), became leader

### Central Asian Influx

**Pattern**:
- Joined ISIS by fighting in Syria
- As Syria operations wind down, not returning to Central Asia
- Not senior enough for Beluchistan leadership positions
- Joining ISIS-K instead
- Increases Central Asian composition

## Iranian IRGC Relationships

### Historical Context: Al-Qaeda in Iran

**Post-9/11 Flight** (2001):
- When U.S. invaded Afghanistan, senior Al-Qaeda leaders fled
- Two destinations: Pakistan and Iran
- Most did not stay in Afghanistan to fight

**Pakistan Path**:
- Pakistani government took U.S. money
- Began capturing terrorists (example: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed captured)
- Result: Terrorists decided Pakistan unsafe

**Iran Path**:
- Terrorists and families relocated to Iran
- Lived there with wives and children
- Developed close relationships with Iranian government
- Safer haven than Pakistan
- Iran harbored Al-Qaeda through entire Afghanistan War (2001-2021)

### Key IRGC Figure: Qasem Soleimani (Deceased)

**Position**: Head of Iranian Quds Force (IRGC special operations)

**Al-Qaeda Protection**:
- Personally oversaw Al-Qaeda protection
- Created infrastructure to harbor terrorists
- Protected Al-Qaeda senior leaders during entire 20-year war when U.S. "trying to hunt them unsuccessfully inside Afghanistan"

**Death**:
- January 2020
- U.S. drone strike in Iraq
- Ordered by President Donald Trump
- Trump put lethal authorities in place specifically to allow targeting

**Significance to Iran**:
- "Qasem Soleimani isn't just a man in Iran - he was the symbol of the Iranian Revolution"
- "Like our Capitol or our Statue of Liberty - bigger than a man"
- Iran blames Trump "almost solely" for death

### Current Key Figure: Mohammad Kazemi

**Current Position**:
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
- One of most senior intelligence officials in Iran
- NOT Quds Force head (different position)

**History**:
- Close friend and colleague of Soleimani
- Tasked by Soleimani: Keep Al-Qaeda leaders safe
- Specifically protected:
  - Hamza bin Laden
  - Saif al-Adel
  - Benghazi plotter (how Adams' team knows this so well)

**Current Activities** (2024):

1. **October 7th Hamas Attack Planning**:
   - Co-plotter with Al-Qaeda and Taliban
   - Key operations coordinator
   - Travels regularly to Afghanistan
   - Coordinates with Taliban and Al-Qaeda

2. **Soleimani Revenge Plot** ("Soleimani Plot"):
   - Mastermind of plot against President Trump
   - **Budget**: $145 million per month
   - "You don't assassinate a president with $145 million a month - there's more to this plot"
   - May include U.S. Capitol attack ("Maybe it's the Capitol, the entire Capitol, the building")
   - May include multiple high-value targets
   - Iran requires equivalent response: Soleimani was symbol, response must match symbolic value

3. **Ongoing Coordination**:
   - Regular visits to Afghanistan (Kandahar)
   - Coordinates with Al-Qaeda leadership
   - Coordinates with Taliban leadership
   - Plans future operations

**Intelligence Failure**:
- **Not on FBI Most Wanted List**
- Minimal U.S. recognition
- "He's the Mastermind behind a plot against a former US president - he's not even on our Wanted list"
- After Adams published findings: No U.S. government agency contacted her team
- Foreign intelligence confirmed information accurate
- U.S. government: Silence

### Current IRGC-Al-Qaeda Cooperation (2024)

**Intelligence Sharing**:
- 100% confirmed intelligence sharing between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian government receives intelligence from terrorist groups
- Terrorists receive intelligence from Iran

**Intelligence Base in Afghanistan**:
- Located: Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Iranian government has intelligence base inside the camp
- Co-mingled operations

**Kandahar Visitors**:
Regular visitors to Kandahar (meeting with each other AND Taliban):
- Iranians (IRGC)
- Russians
- Chinese
- North Koreans

**October 7th Coordination**:

**Planning Participants**:
- **Al-Qaeda**: Saif al-Adel and others
- **Taliban**: Hibatullah Akhundzada (issued fatwa)
- **Iran IRGC**: Mohammad Kazemi, various generals
- **Iranian Internal Units**: Various components
- **Hamas**: Operational representatives

**Approval Process**:
- Hibatullah Akhundzada issued religious fatwa for attack
- IRGC general gave final "go" order
- Demonstrates deep coordination across Sunni-Shia divide

**Logistics**:
- Iranian resources
- Afghan training camps
- Taliban approval and support
- Al-Qaeda planning and coordination
- Hamas execution

### Uranium and Dirty Bomb Development

**Location**: Chinese-operated uranium mines in Afghanistan (at least two provinces in southern Afghanistan)

**Co-location**:
- Chinese personnel
- Al-Qaeda operatives
- IRGC representatives
- "Same building" - all three together

**Purpose**:
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- Not nuclear weapons development ("not exactly")
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- "Think of that as they innovate on that and grow"

**Chinese Role**:
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"
- Chinese aware and allowing IRGC-Al-Qaeda collaboration
- May be providing resources or expertise

### Analyst Denialism

**Common Intelligence Assessment**:
- "Iran doesn't get along with Al-Qaeda"
- "Iran is attacking Al-Qaeda"

**Reality Check**:
- Iran harbored Al-Qaeda through entire Afghanistan War (2001-2021)
- Senior Al-Qaeda leadership lived in Iran safely for years
- Current ongoing operational coordination
- Joint planning of major attacks
- Intelligence sharing and bases

**Why Analysts Wrong**:
- Outdated sectarian assumptions (Sunni vs. Shia)
- Failure to recognize ideological flexibility
- Not tracking actual relationships
- Ignoring evidence
- Relying on old frameworks

### Strategic Implications

**Unified Front**:
- Sunni and Shia terrorist groups cooperating
- State actors (Iran) and non-state actors (Al-Qaeda) aligned
- Breaks traditional Middle East conflict patterns
- Creates more dangerous threat environment

**Safe Haven**:
- Al-Qaeda had safe haven in Iran during U.S. war
- Now has safe haven in Afghanistan
- Iran provides additional security and support
- Allows long-term planning impossible without state protection

**Resource Sharing**:
- Iranian intelligence capabilities
- Al-Qaeda terrorist networks
- Taliban territory and training camps
- Combined: formidable capability

## State Actor Coordination

### Russia's Role

#### Ukraine War Connection

**October 7th Planning** (March 2022):
- Russia invaded Ukraine (February 2022)
- Terrorists began planning October 7th (March 2022)
- Terrorists contacted Russia: "Is timing okay?"
- Russia: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"
- Russia wanted distraction from Ukraine

**July 2022 Delay Discussion**:
- U.S. killed Zawahiri
- Al-Qaeda wanted to delay attack to 2023
- Contacted Russia about delay
- Russia response: "No, do it in 2022, don't wait. I need pressure off me for my war in Ukraine"
- Al-Qaeda delayed anyway (their decision)

#### U.S. Homeland Attack Support

**Supply Chain Support**:
- "Russian pipelines are helping bring in some of the resources that are going to support Al-Qaeda's Homeland attack"
- "Their pipeline is helping move some of Al-Qaeda's supplies into the United States for the Homeland attack"
- Adams knows what specific supplies but didn't fully disclose for security reasons

**Purpose**:
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- "Push at us for Ukraine just like we're doing stuff against Russia"
- Asymmetric response using terrorists as proxies

**Strategic Logic**:
- Al-Qaeda will pull off attack
- Will be blamed on ISIS
- No one will call it Al-Qaeda
- "Definitely no one's going to say Russia played a piece in it"
- Perfect deniability
- "Very smart of them"

#### ISIS-K and Russia Deception

**Moscow Attacks**: Executed by Branch One (Sanaullah's ISIS-K)

**The Deception**:
- Russia knows about Branch One threat
- Working with Taliban against ISIS-K
- Real threat to Russia: Branch Two (Ghulam Kohistani in north)
- Taliban hiding this from Russia
- Making Russia focus on Branch One
- Sirajuddin Haqqani funding and protecting Branch Two
- Russia doesn't understand full picture

**Russia's Vulnerability**:
- Has to work with Taliban to collect intelligence on ISIS
- "Just like we do"
- Taliban playing both sides
- Giving Russia information on one branch
- Hiding the branch actually threatening them

### China's Role

#### Afghanistan Resources

**Lithium and Uranium**:
- Afghanistan has significant lithium deposits (widely known)
- Also has significant uranium deposits (less discussed)
- Chinese have negotiated mining rights since before U.S. withdrawal

**Uranium Mines**:
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- "Essentially owned and run by China"
- Chinese personnel on site
- Active mining operations

**Dirty Bomb Development**:
- Al-Qaeda operatives present at uranium mines
- IRGC representatives present
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, Al-Qaeda together
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium use for dirty bombs
- Chinese aware and allowing it

#### Long-Term Strategy

**Current Assessment**: "A little more of a longer game"

**Meetings in Kandahar**:
- Chinese representatives regularly visit
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with other state actors present
- Building relationships and agreements

**Proxy Potential**:
- "China is meeting with the terrorists"
- "I do think China is going to find a way to use the terrorists as proxies"
- If U.S.-China war occurs, China will likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Infrastructure already being built
- Relationships being established
- Resources being positioned

**Not Immediate**:
- U.S. homeland attack appears primarily Al-Qaeda/Iran/Russia supported
- China more background role currently
- Building capability for future use

#### Belt and Road Initiative

**Strategic Alignment**:
- Part of China's Belt and Road Initiative
- Mullah Baradar was Taliban-China liaison since 2009
- Baradar traveled to China for meetings
- Relationship maintained during entire war

**China-Iran Oil Deal**:
- If U.S. comes to war with China "and shit hits the fan"
- China will get oil from Iran
- **Afghanistan will be used as land route for Iranian oil**
- China worried U.S. will cut off oil supplies from South America or Africa
- Land route insurance

**Bagram Air Base**:
- "One of more key strategic bases in world"
- Now where **Chinese PMCs (private military contractors) are based**

**Chinese Presence**:
- Northern Alliance reports Chinese officials "everywhere"
- "Building massive hotels right outside of these lithium deposits"
- "Huge multi-million dollar structures"
- Unusual for Afghanistan: "In the middle of nowhere"

**Official Status**:
- China is first and only country with official ambassador to Taliban government
- "First and only country that has assigned an official ambassador to the Taliban government"
- Others have "weird envoys"

### North Korea's Role

**Kandahar Presence**:
- Regular visitors to Kandahar
- Meetings with Taliban and other state actors
- Part of broader anti-U.S. coordination

**Specific Activities**: Less detailed in source materials but confirmed present

### India's Complex Role

**India-Taliban Payments**:
- $10 million Indian payment to Mullah Yaqub funded Bagram base
- Bagram use: Where Hibatullah's (supreme Taliban leader) personal security is based
- "Indian government or intel service funding Hibatullah's personal security - isn't that weird?"

**India Using Taliban Networks**:
- **India is using Taliban networks to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan**
- Killing Kashmir militants all over Pakistan (Lahore, Karachi, etc.)
- Also killing Sikh militants

**18 Targeted for Assassination**:
- Groups: Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen
- **Not one from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen** - this is key

**The Theory - Kashmir Future War Plan**:
- Hibatullah connection: Religious teaching from Fazal Rahman Khalil (founded Hizb-ul-Mujahideen)
- Taliban and HuM decided to work together
- Use India to eliminate Kashmir militants aligned to Pakistan
- India doesn't understand this is what's happening
- Kashmir militants are Pakistani nationalists, Pakistan loyalists
- Can't be used in Fat War plan or future Kashmir war plan
- Taking out old guard of Kashmir militant leaders
- New generation of Kashmir militants after training in Kashmir fought in Afghanistan
- Fought with Taliban against Americans
- **New generation more aligned to Taliban and Al-Qaeda than Pakistani military**
- "Creating this whole new Kashmir landscape nobody has thought about and nobody's ready for"

### Pakistan's Role

**TTP (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan)**:
- GDI "Immigrants Department" solely funds and supports TTP
- Conducted 800 attacks in Pakistan last year
- Afghan Taliban rotating units into TTP for attacks (part of Fat War plan)
- When Pakistani military kills attackers and identifies Afghan Taliban: dismissed as "you always blame Afghans"

**ISIS-K Safe Haven**:
- Most ISIS-K training camps in Pakistan
- Largest camp: Turbat, Pakistan (Baluchistan), protected by Pakistan Frontier Corps
- Frontier Corps infiltrated by ISIS-K, harboring and working with them
- Provides security at embassies in Pakistan (huge insider threat)

**Kashmir Militants**:
- Old guard being eliminated (Pakistan loyalists)
- New generation aligned with Taliban/Al-Qaeda
- Pakistan unaware of landscape shift

**ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)**:
- Adams restarted CIA-ISI cooperation with one phone call
- Negotiated handshake agreement on Zawahiri
- Captured Younis Al-Mauritani
- Complex relationship with terrorism

### Coordination Meetings in Kandahar

**Regular Attendees**:
- Russians
- Chinese
- North Koreans
- Iranians (IRGC)
- Taliban leadership
- Al-Qaeda leadership

**Activities**:
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with each other
- Coordinate operations
- Share intelligence
- Plan collaborative efforts

**Intelligence Base**:
- Iranian government intelligence base inside Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Russian contacts and coordination
- Chinese presence (uranium mines and other interests)
- North Korean representatives

**Co-mingling**:
- State actors and non-state actors operating in same space
- Near-peer adversaries coordinating with terrorists
- Multiple agendas being pursued simultaneously
- All in Taliban-controlled territory

### Near-Peer Competition Reality

**Current State**: "We're in near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists"

**Multiple Players**:
- U.S. thinks it can use Sirajuddin Haqqani against Russia
- Russia using terrorists against U.S.
- China positioning for future use
- Iran actively coordinating operations
- "Everybody's playing this game with the terrorists now"

**The Problem**:
- Everyone thinks they're manipulating terrorists
- Terrorists playing all sides
- Getting resources from multiple state actors
- Building capability beyond any single sponsor
- More sophisticated and dangerous than ever

**Taliban as Power Players**:
- "Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are power players"
- "People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country by our enemies"
- "They're treating them with respect"
- "What can you do for me, what can I do for you"

**Combined State Actor Support for U.S. Homeland Attack**:

**Russia**: Supply chain support, moving resources into U.S., direct logistical support

**Iran**: Intelligence and planning (Kazemi), coordination with Al-Qaeda, IRGC resources, operational support

**China**: Resources in Afghanistan (uranium), meeting with terrorists, building long-term relationships, possibly future direct support

**North Korea**: Present in Kandahar, meetings with terrorists and other state actors, part of anti-U.S. coordination

**Effect**:
- Multiple state actors supporting same operation
- Each has plausible deniability
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- No state actor will be implicated
- Near-perfect operational security
- Unprecedented coordination level

## Training Camp Infrastructure

### Scale and Organization

**Total Camps**: 30+ Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan (2024)

**Breakdown**:
- **7 camps**: Suicide bomber training exclusively (~20% of camps)

- **Total: Approximately 13,500 trained in recent major operations**
- Islamic Army overall: Approximately 120,000 trained

### Management and Control

**Overall Manager**: Abdullah bin Laden (Al-Qaeda Number Three, COO)
- Manages 30+ training camps
- Oversees recruitment of 100,000+ fighters
- Coordinates training curriculum
- Manages camp infrastructure and supplies
- Receives portion of U.S. weekly funding
- Coordinates with Taliban on camp locations and security

**Security**: GDI 12th Department
- Sole job: Protect Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan
- Protect all 30 Al-Qaeda training camps
- Vet all new recruits (Afghan, Jordanian, Syrian, Egyptian) before training
- Move all new trainees (into camps, between locations)
- Move Al-Qaeda senior leadership
- Harbor senior leadership in their own houses
- Protect Al-Qaeda cash holdings in Afghanistan
- Control all border movements for Al-Qaeda

**Funding**:
- U.S. weekly cash deliveries ($44-87 million/week)
- Minimum $5 million per month through refugee program (Khalil Haqqani/Abdulaziz Haqqani)

- Chinese money ($10 billion investments - $3 billion to Al-Qaeda)
- Iranian support
- Russian support

### Training Curriculum

**Standard Training**:
- Weapons training
- Driving training
- Physical endurance
- Urban warfare (specific threat identified)

**Specialized Training**:

1. **Advanced Urban Warfare**
   - Extended training program
   - Tactics seen in Taliban training videos
   - High proficiency level
   - Professional-level skills demonstrated publicly

2. **Suicide Bombing Training**
   - Separate specialized camps (20% of all camps)
   - "Invisible bomb vest" technology
   - Defeats magnetometers and K-9 detection
   - Developed by AQAP (Yemen branch)
   - Video demonstration released December 2023

3. **Cover and Covert Operations**
   - Don't mention Afghanistan
   - Don't mention Al-Qaeda
   - Use fake names even in training camps
   - "If we're in camp together I don't know your name is Shawn Ryan. I know you as [fake name]"
   - Extensive operational security
   - Long-term placement strategies

**Not Included**:
- No IED construction programs (notably absent from current training)
- Focus shifted to direct action and suicide operations

### Camp Organization Methods

**By Ethnicity**:
- Some camps don't mix Libyans with Somalians or Syrians
- Arabs vs. non-Arabs sometimes separated
- Helps maintain operational security
- Reduces ethnic tensions

**By Training Type**:
- Suicide bombing: 20% of camps specialize
- Advanced urban warfare: Dedicated camps
- Cover and covert operations: Specialized training
- Mixed general training: Other camps

**By Organization**:
- Traditionally: Al-Qaeda camps, ISIS camps, etc.
- Now: "Islamic Army" umbrella
- Recruits emerge identified as Islamic Army
- Creates attribution confusion for intelligence services

### Multi-Generational Planning

**Family Integration**: Al-Qaeda learned from previous mistakes about generational planning

**Old Problem**:
- Focused on first generation
- Didn't train second/third generation
- When U.S. drone strikes eliminated leaders, replacements inadequate
- "Third and fourth string of external operations sucked"

**New Approach**:
- Encourage marriage
- Bring in women from fighter's home country
  - Syrian fighter? Bring Syrian women
  - Don't force marriage to Afghans
- Create "whole Jihadi family"
- Train the children
- Multi-generational commitment

**Support Structure**:
- Housing provided
- Weapons provided
- Training provided
- Financial stipend
- Marriage arrangement assistance
- Education for children in ideology
- Complete social safety net

**Terrorist Testimony** (from documentary "Jihad Rehab"):
- Former Al-Qaeda member asked: "Was life easier in Afghanistan?"
- Answer: "Yes"
- Reason: Complete social safety net provided
- Everything taken care of
- Focus entirely on jihad and training

**Long-term Goal**: "We're never going to have that failure again where the second generation can't step up"

### Recruitment and Training Philosophy

**Training Intensity**: "Remember their life is they train all the time. If that's all you're doing all day long I mean you're going to get really competent in it. And then they have different emotions behind it too and different beliefs and the religion behind it too which makes you more devout."

**No Lack of Bodies**: "There is no lack of bodies. There's no lack of terrorist volunteering."

**Recruitment Sources**:
- Afghanistan
- Pakistan
- Syria
- Libya
- Somalia
- Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan)
- Arab countries (Saudi, Kuwait, Jordan)
- North Africa

**Why So Many Recruits**:

1. **Social Safety Net**: Complete life support, housing, food, stipend, marriage assistance, family support

2. **Purpose and Belonging**: Religious framework, brotherhood, clear mission and goals

3. **Training and Weapons**: Professional military training, access to weapons, skills development, prestige in community

4. **Ideology**: Religious duty, martyrdom ideology, anti-Western sentiment, various personal motivations

### Specific Camp Locations

**Afghanistan**:
- 30+ Al-Qaeda camps
- 7 suicide bomber training camps
- 23 general training camps
- Uruzgan province (Hamas training)
- Kandahar province (Hamas training, planning meetings)
- Kunar Province (ISIS-K headquarters)
- Khost Province (various operations)
- Adams' team identified three main camps with high confidence

**Pakistan**:
- All ISIS-K training camps located in Pakistan
- Largest: Turbat, Pakistan (Baluchistan) - named Rozi
- Protected by Pakistan's Frontier Corps
- Multiple other locations
- Baluchistan region (real ISIS leadership relocated here)

**Libya** (Historical):
- Was supposed to become training camp hub (failed)
- Now terrorist facilitators moved to Afghanistan
- Some operations continue but primarily business/funding

### Iranian Intelligence Base

**Location**: Inside Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar

```

**Attribution Strategy**:
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- Taliban has been feeding U.S. intel on ISIS-K terrorists for years
- Small pieces entering U.S. intelligence databases
- Creating paper trail
- After attack: U.S. will search databases
- Will find: "Yeah we had pieces on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers will have database entries all pointing to ISIS
- Result: U.S. intelligence will confirm "It's an ISIS attack"
- Will not recognize: Al-Qaeda, Taliban involvement, state actors (Russia, Iran, China)
- **"That's how well they've planned this"** - Sarah Adams

**Status (December 2024)**:
- Training: Completed
- Deployment: Completed ("already deployed")
- Entry: Ongoing/completed (many believed already in U.S.)
- Timing: 2025 planned
- Preparation: Attackers positioning, waiting for orders

### Embassy Attacks (Wave Two) - Command Structure

**Three Categories**:

1. **Middle East Embassies**
   - Purpose: Push U.S. out for caliphate expansion
   - Specific target: U.S. Embassy Baghdad

2. **African Embassies**
   - Purpose: Push U.S. out for caliphate expansion
   - Specific targets: Multiple locations (some withheld for security)
   - Confirmed: Bamako, Mali
   - Threat: Abu Muhammad al-Masri deployed to Mali (best operational planner)

3. **European Embassies**
   - Purpose: Target U.S. for Middle East involvement
   - Will coordinate with broader European attacks

**Command**:
- Overall planning: Al-Qaeda Core (Saif al-Adel, others)
- Training: Afghanistan camps
- Facilitation: Musa (document forger)
- Local execution: Regional Al-Qaeda branches

**Status**: Planning advanced, some operations ready to execute

### European Attacks (Wave Three) - Command Structure

**Scale**: 1,000 trained terrorists deployed for European operations

**Type**: October 7th-style coordinated attacks across Europe

**Components**:
- Embassy attacks
- Mass casualty attacks
- Coordination with U.S. homeland attacks

**Training**: Separate 1,000 fighters, separate training from U.S. homeland attackers

**Status**: Trained and deployed

**Source**: Detailed in "AQ 2.0: The Upcoming Attack on the United States and Europe Unveiled" (European retired intelligence officer compilation)

### Syria Deployment (Wave Five - Caliphate) - Command Structure

**Scale**: 10,000 fighters deployed (recently completed)

**Purpose**: Support Julani's blitz, expand caliphate

**Training**: Taliban provided training camps in Afghanistan

**Result**:
- Operations in Syria recently completed
- Fighting continues (Kurds, others)
- Media only reported HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham)
- No mention of Al-Qaeda or Taliban involvement

**Next Deployment Options**:
- Iraq (caliphate wave)

## Evolution and Historical Development

### Pre-9/11 Structure

**Al-Qaeda Traditional Model**:
- Osama bin Laden: Overall leader
- Regional branches: Relatively independent
- Afghanistan base: Training and planning
- Sectarian divisions: Sunni organization only
- State relationships: Limited, primarily Pakistan and Sudan

**Vision**: Islamic caliphate, but more aspirational than operational

### Post-9/11 Evolution (2001-2010)

**Dispersal Phase**:
- U.S. invasion forced dispersion
- Leaders fled to Pakistan and Iran
- Afghanistan lost as base
- Training camps destroyed
- Organizations fractured

**Pakistan Safe Haven**:
- Terrorists fled to Pakistan
- Some captured by ISI (taking U.S. money)
- Others maintained safe havens
- Led to drone strike campaign

**Iran Safe Haven**:
- Senior leaders relocated with families
- Iranian government protection (Qasem Soleimani)
- Lived safely through entire 20-year war
- Maintained command structure
- Protected by Kazemi specifically

**Organizational Challenges**:
- External operations commanders repeatedly killed
- "Third and fourth string" inadequate
- Generational planning failures
- No family integration
- Difficulty maintaining capability

### Benghazi Era (2011-2012)

**Libya Post-Gaddafi**:
- Al-Qaeda enters Libya after Gaddafi falls
- New model: Appoint local commanders as Al-Qaeda leaders
- Don't bring in foreigners
- Integration with local militias
- Business operations alongside terrorism

**Benghazi Attacks Innovation**:
- Multiple Al-Qaeda branches coordinated
- Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri: Overall coordinator
- AQIM: Primary execution
- AQAP: Funding and fatwa
- Egyptian Al-Qaeda: Personnel
- Demonstrated multi-branch capability

**Individual Who Provided Attackers**:
- Same person provided Tunisian suicide bombers to Ahmad Shah Massoud (2001)
- Provided attackers to Zawahiri for Benghazi (2012)
- "Still in play" (2023)
- Continuity of terrorist networks over decades

**Key Learning**: Local integration model successful

### ISIS Rise and Competition (2012-2017)

**ISIS Formation**:
- Broke from Al-Qaeda
- Focused on territorial control (caliphate)
- Syria and Iraq operations
- Rivaled Al-Qaeda for recruits and resources

**Al-Qaeda Response**:
- Maintained networks
- Continued external operations focus
- Khorasan Group formation
- Competed for foreign fighters

**Sectarian Narrative**:
- U.S. intelligence: "ISIS and Al-Qaeda are enemies"
- Reality: More complex, some cooperation even then
- Example: Hashim Abu Cidra - dual role ISIS/Al-Qaeda in Libya

### Afghanistan Withdrawal Era (2020-2021)

**Doha Deal (2020)**:
- U.S. negotiations with Taliban
- Secret annexes never released
- Peace deal actually with Bin Ladens (married to Mullah Omar's family)
- U.S. didn't acknowledge or didn't understand

**Zawahiri Presence**:
- July 31, 2022: Zawahiri killed in Kabul
- Staying at house owned by Sirajuddin Haqqani
- Confirmed Taliban harboring Al-Qaeda senior leaders
- Demonstrated ongoing relationship

**Kabul Fall (August 2021)**:
- Taliban takes control
- U.S. abandons Bagram (July 1, 2021)
- Biometric databases left behind
- Abbey Gate attack (August 26, 2021)
- Al-Qaeda and terrorists flood back into Afghanistan

**Immediate Changes**:
- Safe haven established
- Training camps reopened
- 30+ camps operating
- No U.S. drone strikes
- Freedom of movement and planning

### Islamic Army Formation (2022-2024)

**Hamza bin Laden Emergence**:
- Left Iran after Soleimani death (January 2020)
- Moved to Pakistan (Waziristan) 2020-2021
- Moved to Afghanistan after Kabul fall (2021)
- Located in Kandahar (2022)
- Assumed leadership of Al-Qaeda
- U.S. falsely claims he's dead

**Key Innovation**: Fulfilling father's original vision

**Formation Process**:
- Negotiations with all major groups
- Compromises on territorial control
- Sectarian divide overcome
- Common goals identified
- Unified command structure created

**October 7th as Proof of Concept** (2023):
- First major Islamic Army operation
- Al-Qaeda planning
- Taliban support and fatwa
- Iranian IRGC coordination
- Hamas execution
- Sunni-Shia cooperation demonstrated
- Success proved model works

**Current State** (2024):
- 120,000+ fighters trained under Islamic Army umbrella
- Multiple waves of operations planned and executing
- State actor support (Iran, Russia, China, North Korea)
- Training infrastructure established
- Funding secured (U.S., China, others)
- Multi-generational planning implemented

### Key Strategic Shifts

**From**: Sectarian division (Sunni vs. Shia)
**To**: Unified Islamic Army (sectarian differences subordinated)

**From**: Territorial control focus
**To**: Political influence with ISIS controlling territory

**From**: Public responsibility claims
**To**: "Hidden Hand" operations with plausible deniability

**From**: Al-Qaeda only
**To**: Multi-group integration under single command

**From**: Non-state actor
**To**: State actor support and coordination

**From**: Individual operations
**To**: Wave-based coordinated campaigns

**From**: Single-generation focus
**To**: Multi-generational planning with family integration

**From**: Pakistan safe haven (lost)
**To**: Afghanistan safe haven (secure) with Iran backup

**From**: Drone strikes limiting capability
**To**: No strikes, freedom of operation

**From**: Degraded external operations
**To**: Advanced planning for homeland attacks

### Osama bin Laden's Vision vs. Current Reality

**Osama's Goals** (Original):
1. Push U.S. out of Middle East
2. Restore Islamic Caliphate
3. Economic damage to West
4. Homeland attacks on U.S.
5. Unity across Muslim terrorist groups

**Current Status Under Hamza**:
1. ✅ **In Progress**: Embassy attacks, October 7th
2. ✅ **In Progress**: Syria, Mali, Somalia operations
3. ✅ **Planned**: Infrastructure, bridge, metro targets
4. ✅ **Planned**: 1,000+ fighters trained, deployed
5. ✅ **Achieved**: Islamic Army formed

**Key Difference**:
- Osama: Patient, willing to take 1,000 years
- Hamza: Wants everything in his lifetime, fast approvals

**Result**: Osama's vision being realized faster than he planned

### Command Philosophy Evolution

**Old Model (Al-Qaeda traditional)**:
- Train cell together
- Deploy cell together
- Cell conducts attack
- Public responsibility claims

**New Model (Islamic Army)**:
- Train individuals separately
- Deploy individually or small groups
- Senior coordinators positioned separately
- False identities and operational security
- Real-time flexibility
- No public responsibility
- Different groups may claim same attack
- "Hidden Hand" approach

**Benefits**:
- Harder to detect
- Harder to disrupt
- Operational security maintained
- Attribution confused
- Protects safe havens
- Allows state actor support without exposure

## Conclusion

The formation of the Islamic Army under Hamza bin Laden represents the most significant evolution in terrorist organizational structure since 9/11. The integration of previously rival groups (Al-Qaeda and ISIS), the bridging of the Sunni-Shia sectarian divide (Al-Qaeda/ISIS with Hamas/Hezbollah/Iran), and the coordination with multiple state actors (Iran, Russia, China, North Korea) has created an unprecedented threat capability.

**Key Findings**:

1. **Unified Command**: The Islamic Army is real, operational, and actively conducting coordinated campaigns (October 7th proved the model works)

2. **State Actor Support**: Multiple near-peer adversaries are providing resources, intelligence, and logistical support while maintaining plausible deniability

3. **Safe Haven**: Afghanistan provides secure base for training 30+ camps, harboring leadership, and planning operations without U.S. drone strikes

4. **Multi-Generational**: Family integration ensures capability continues for decades

5. **Wave-Based Operations**: Coordinated campaigns (Israel, embassies, Europe, U.S. homeland) demonstrate strategic planning beyond traditional terrorism

6. **U.S. Funding**: Approximately $44-87 million per week flowing from U.S. to designated terrorists and training camps that are training homeland attackers

7. **Family Connections**: Peace deal with Taliban was actually with Bin Ladens (married to Mullah Omar's family) - U.S. paying both sides of same family structure

8. **Intelligence Pre-Planting**: Years of careful intelligence seeding to ensure attribution to ISIS rather than Al-Qaeda or state actors

9. **"Hidden Hand" Philosophy**: No public responsibility claims, multiple groups blame for same operations, confusion in attribution protects safe havens and state sponsors

10. **Speed of Operations**: Hamza bin Laden approves operations in single meeting (vs. father's 5-year deliberation for 9/11), creating faster operational tempo

**The Hierarchy Reality**:

Traditional org charts cannot capture the fluid, overlapping, and deliberately opaque command structure of the Islamic Army. The same individuals hold multiple roles across multiple organizations. State actors coordinate with non-state actors as peers. Sectarian divisions subordinated to operational goals. The "hierarchy" is less a pyramid and more a network of interlocking relationships unified by common goals and facilitated by state actor support.

**Most Critical Point**:

This structure fulfills Osama bin Laden's original vision but operates faster, more secretly, with more resources, and with state-level support he never achieved. The U.S. government's refusal to acknowledge the Islamic Army's existence, continued funding of its components, and suppression of intelligence about Hamza bin Laden leaves America vulnerable to attacks that are not theoretical possibilities but documented plans with trained attackers already deployed.

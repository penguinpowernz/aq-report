### Al-Qaeda Rebranding

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of locations demonstrates the global reach and coordination of Al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist networks. Afghanistan serves as the central hub with 30 training camps and international coordination in Kandahar. The network spans from safe havens in Iran and Pakistan, through operational bases in Libya and Turkey, to attack planning for targets across Europe and the United States.

Key strategic locations include:
- **Kandahar, Afghanistan**: International coordination hub (Iranian, Russian, Chinese, North Korean visitors)
- **Kabul, Afghanistan**: Planning center and harboring location
- **Panjgur, Pakistan**: Real ISIS leadership headquarters
- **Benghazi, Libya**: Historical attack site, continued operations
- **Darien Gap, Panama**: Primary terrorist infiltration choke point
- **Turkey**: Transit and finance hub
- **Iran**: Safe haven and operational coordination

The reports document unprecedented cooperation between traditional enemies (Sunni and Shia groups), state-level support from Iran, Russia, and China, and a systematic plan for attacks across multiple continents in coordinated waves.

The geographic analysis reveals a sophisticated global network that has reconstituted to levels exceeding pre-9/11 capability, with training infrastructure, safe havens, financial networks, and operational planning spanning dozens of countries across six continents.

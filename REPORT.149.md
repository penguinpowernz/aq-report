**Air Date:** December 2024
**Guest:** Sarah Adams (Call Sign: "Super Bad")
**Host:** Shawn Ryan
**Episode Number:** 149

---

## Executive Summary

This episode of the Shawn Ryan Show features Sarah Adams, a former CIA counterterrorism officer and targeter, discussing critical intelligence concerning imminent terrorist threats to the United States and its allies. Adams reveals that Al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Hamza bin Laden, has trained and deployed approximately 1,000 terrorists for attacks within the United States, with additional forces prepared for coordinated attacks in Europe. She details how the U.S. government continues to fund the Taliban with $44-87 million per week, money that directly supports terrorist training camps. Adams also exposes Pentagon interference with her open-source intelligence sharing, the formation of a unified "Islamic Army" combining Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Taliban forces, and reveals that the October 7th Hamas attacks were planned and executed in coordination with Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and Iran. The episode provides extensive detail on terrorist training methodologies, attack planning timelines, and specific vulnerabilities in U.S. homeland security. Adams emphasizes that law enforcement and state governments are receiving no threat information from federal agencies, leaving Americans unprepared for what she describes as inevitable attacks planned for 2025.

## Pentagon Controversy and Open Source Intelligence

### Definition of Open Source Intelligence
- Information collected entirely through non-classified channels
- Does not involve foreign militaries or intelligence community resources
- Publicly available information that can be shared freely
- Sarah Adams and her team collect information independently on the ground

### The Pentagon Incident
**Timeline:** Week of interview (December 2024)

Sarah Adams received a threatening communication from the Pentagon after she shared threat intelligence about planned attacks against a U.S. Embassy in Africa with appropriate officials.

**Details:**
- Adams identified threats against U.S. embassies in Africa
- She reached out directly to embassy staff including:
  - The Ambassador
  - RSO (Regional Security Officer) responsible for embassy security
- Pentagon sent a "nasty gram" complaining she didn't use "formal channels"
- Pentagon showed no concern for:
  - The actual threat
  - Safety of embassy personnel (including DOD personnel)
  - Source information
  - Intelligence details

**Pentagon's Focus:**
- Only concerned that Adams provided information directly
- No interest in collaboration or threat assessment
- No follow-up on the intelligence itself
- Criticized information sharing despite it being unclassified

**Adams' Assessment:**
The Pentagon's response demonstrates they prioritize bureaucratic protocols over personnel safety and fail to recognize or act on legitimate threat intelligence from open-source channels.

## Al-Qaeda Threats and Attack Plans

### The Islamic Caliphate Strategy

Al-Qaeda has developed a multi-wave attack strategy designed to:
1. Push the United States out of the Middle East
2. Restore and expand the Islamic Caliphate
3. Create economic damage to Western nations
4. Conduct mass casualty attacks in the U.S. and Europe

**Caliphate Geographic Vision:**
- Core territories: Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq
- North Africa: Complete control across the region
- Future expansion: Spain (referencing historical Islamic control)
- Aspirational: India

### Wave-Based Attack Planning

Al-Qaeda has organized attacks in coordinated "waves" with different objectives:

**Wave 1: Israel/Hamas Attacks**
- Executed October 7, 2023
- Part of larger Al-Qaeda strategy to push U.S. from Middle East
- Detailed in separate section below

**Wave 2: Embassy Attacks**
Three categories of embassy targeting:

1. **Middle East Embassies**
   - Purpose: Push U.S. out of region for caliphate expansion
   - Specific target mentioned: U.S. Embassy Baghdad

2. **African Embassies**
   - Purpose: Push U.S. out for caliphate expansion
   - Specific threats: Multiple African locations (details partially withheld for security)
   - Mentioned location: Bamako, Mali

3. **European Embassies**
   - Purpose: Target U.S. for Middle East involvement
   - Will coordinate with broader European attacks

**Wave 3: European Attacks**
- October 7th-style coordinated attacks across Europe
- 1,000 trained terrorists deployed for European operations
- Both embassy and mass casualty attacks planned
- Timing: Coordinated with U.S. homeland attacks

**Wave 4: U.S. Homeland Attacks**
- 1,000+ trained terrorists deployed to United States
- October 7th/Mumbai-style swarming attacks
- Multiple cities simultaneously
- Detailed in Homeland Attack Planning section

**Wave 5: Caliphate Expansion**
- Syria: 10,000 fighters deployed (recently completed)
- Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso: Ongoing operations
- Iraq: Continued operations

### Training Infrastructure

**Training Timeline Factors:**
- Number of attackers determines duration
- Type of training required
- Camp capacity limitations
- Ethnic/national groupings

**Examples:**
- Hamas attack: 1,500 fighters
  - Originally planned: 2 months training (August-October 2022)
  - Actually received: Over 1 year (pushed to October 2023)

- Syria deployment: 10,000 fighters
  - Requires extensive time due to volume
  - Advanced urban warfare training

- U.S. Homeland attack: 1,000 fighters
  - Advanced urban warfare
  - Suicide bombing training (20% of camps)
  - Cover and covert operations training

**Camp Organization:**
- Some camps segregated by ethnicity
- Arabs may be separated from non-Arabs
- Libyans, Somalians, Syrians may train separately
- Specialized camps for suicide bombing (approximately 20% of total camps)

### The "Invisible Bomb" Vest

**Development Timeline:** Highlighted December 2023

**Developer:** Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen branch)

**Capabilities:**
- Passes through standard airport magnetometers
- Components not detectable by trained explosive-sniffing dogs
- Can be worn concealed under clothing
- Allows terrorist to enter secure facilities undetected

**Technology:**
- Video demonstration released December 2023 (quickly removed)
- TSA ignored the demonstration's implications
- Represents significant advancement in suicide vest technology
- Intended for use in U.S. homeland attacks

**Significance:**
- Most U.S. buildings unprepared for this technology
- Standard security measures (metal detectors, K-9 units) ineffective
- No apparent U.S. government preparation or countermeasures
- Increases vulnerability of all soft targets

### Attack Priority and Timing

**Priority Determination:**
- Not a strict linear priority list
- "Waves" that can run concurrently
- Limited by training capacity and attacker numbers
- Some operations overlap

**What Matters Most:**
- How long training takes
- Number of terrorists needed
- Camp capacity available
- Type of specialized training required

## Funding the Taliban

### Financial Overview

**Weekly Cash Deliveries to Kabul:**
- Initial reports: $40 million per week
- Revised estimates: $44-87 million per week
- Source: U.S. State Department via NGOs
- Confirmed by: Sarah Adams, "Legend," Scott Mann, Ahmad Massoud

**Additional Funding Streams:**

1. **Taliban Political Office in Qatar**
   - At least $10 million per month in operating expenses
   - Funded by U.S. since 2013
   - Separate from weekly Kabul deliveries
   - **Duration:** 11+ years of continuous funding

2. **Supreme Leader's Office Budget**
   - Hibatullah Akhundzada (Taliban Supreme Leader)
   - Total annual budget: $48 million
   - U.S. contribution: Approximately $3 million per month
   - Source: "Counterterrorism dollars"
   - **U.S. covers nearly his entire office budget**

3. **Refugee Program Fraud**
   - Run by: Khalil Haqqani (uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani)
   - Official role: Head of refugees for Taliban
   - Claimed purpose: Resettling Afghan refugees returning from Pakistan to Nangarhar
   - Actual use: Funding Al-Qaeda training camps
   - Amount: $5 million per month
   - Recipient: Abdulaziz Haqqani delivers directly to camps
   - Source: Humanitarian aid dollars
   - Camps contain: Libyan fighters and other foreign nationals

### Distribution and Use of Funds

**Primary Recipients:**
1. **Sirajuddin Haqqani**
   - Receives 5-6 times more than Supreme Leader
   - Approximately $15-18 million per month
   - Taliban's Interior Minister and Haqqani Network leader

2. **Hibatullah Akhundzada**
   - Approximately $3 million per month
   - Supreme Leader of Taliban (Kandahari Taliban faction)

3. **Al-Qaeda Training Camps**
   - Minimum $5 million per month through refugee program
   - Additional unknown amounts through other channels
   - Camps training terrorists for U.S. homeland attacks

### Congressional Inaction

**Petition Results:**
- 382,000+ signatures collected
- Submitted to Congress
- **Result: Zero action taken**

**Legislative Efforts:**

1. **House Bill - Congressman Burchett**
   - Bill introduced to stop Taliban funding
   - Status: Sitting in Senate with no sponsor
   - No senator has picked it up to shepherd through process

2. **Terrorist Designation Bill - Congresswoman Nancy Mace**
   - Purpose: Designate Taliban as terrorist organization
   - Status: Dead
   - Opposition: Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose
   - Result: Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists

**Congressional Leadership:**

**Congressman Michael McCaul (Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee):**
- Recent incident: Public intoxication at airport
- Known issue: Insider trading allegations
- Action on Taliban funding: None
- Pattern: Brings witnesses for "five-minute sound clips"
- No follow-through or accountability measures
- No action following testimony of Tyler Andrew Vargas or others

### Theory Behind Continued Funding

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
Some members of Congress may believe the Haqqani Network (particularly Sirajuddin Haqqani) can be used as a conduit against Russia, particularly regarding the Ukraine war. This is the only logical explanation for the unprecedented funding levels.

**The Ruse:**
- U.S. believes it's playing Kandahari Taliban against Haqqani Network
- Reality: Both factions communicate daily via Telegram
- They coordinate all approvals and information sharing
- Present fake internal conflicts to U.S. officials
- U.S. wastes resources on non-existent political crisis
- Real issues ignored: terrorism, murders, women's apartheid

**Historical Context:**
- U.S. funded Taliban during Afghanistan War
- Funding continued while Taliban killed U.S. soldiers
- Same pattern continues post-withdrawal

### Irony and Propaganda Use

**Al-Qaeda's Messaging:**
- Makes jokes about U.S. funding going to camps training homeland attackers
- Insider joke: "America is funding its own attack"
- Propaganda angle: Will portray as "inside job" by U.S. government
- Goal: Make Americans distrust their government
- Plays into conspiracy theories

**Building Seven Reference:**
- Al-Qaeda found 9/11 conspiracy theories "fascinating"
- Actively studies American conspiracy communities
- Plans to incorporate conspiracy theory elements into attacks
- Goal: Make conspiracy theorists view Al-Qaeda as "revolutionaries and rebels"
- Similar to Hamas supporter dynamics

## Afghan Resistance and Coalition Building

### Current Resistance Groups

**National Resistance Front (NRF):**
- Primary ethnic composition: Tajik
- Leader discussed: Ahmad Massoud
- Confirmed by Scott Mann and Shawn Ryan interview in Vienna
- Cannot win alone due to ethnic limitations

**Other Resistance Components:**
- Pashtun resistance groups
- Hazara groups
- Various ethnic and regional factions
- Women's resistance movement

**General Zia:**
- NRF military leader
- Sarah Adams' preferred military commander
- Noted for tactical capabilities

### Problems with Current Resistance Structure

**Lack of Unity:**
- Groups remain compartmentalized
- Minimal public collaboration
- Annual Vienna meeting insufficient
- Some private coordination exists but limited

**Internal Undermining:**
- Groups gossip about each other
- Accusations of working with Iranians or Russians
- Not functioning as united front against Taliban
- Some groups focused only on regional control
- Some don't want to remain part of Afghanistan if Taliban falls

**Taliban Sympathizers:**
- Example: One Afghan Directorate of Security (ODS) leadership
- Historical incident: U.S. captured Mullah Baradar (Taliban #2) in Pakistan
- Afghan government requested his release, not rendition
- These sympathizers undercut resistance efforts
- Help keep resistance groups divided

### Libya Comparison

**Libyan Revolution Success Factors:**
- Every group wanted Gaddafi dead (common immediate goal)
- United despite including terrorist groups
- Focused on immediate goal: Remove Gaddafi
- No single military commander, but coordinated action
- External government formed: Council led by Jalel

**Afghanistan's Missing Catalyst:**
- No equivalent unifying goal
- No single enemy everyone agrees must be removed immediately
- Regional interests outweigh national interests

### Adams' Warning to Resistance

**The Stakes:**
If Al-Qaeda's homeland attack succeeds and Afghan resistance hasn't unified to show capability, the U.S. will turn to Pakistan (not the resistance) for action. She specifically stated she would call Pakistan and fund them to eliminate Hamza bin Laden, not a fractured resistance.

**Haiti Example:**
After gangs took over, they immediately formed an interim council - this matters to Western governments even if it doesn't matter to fighters on the ground.

### Recommended Strategy

**Coalition Formation:**
- Fund a coalition of all resistance groups, not just one
- Cannot pick single group (like NRF alone)
- Need representation from:
  - Tajiks (NRF)
  - Pashtun resistance
  - Hazaras
  - Women's movement
  - Other ethnic groups

**Power-Sharing Agreement:**
- No single leader necessary
- Different groups have different access and capabilities
- Each successful in different ways and areas
- Multiple commanders running different operations
- Similar to Libyan model

**External Government:**
- Formal coalition or transitional government structure
- Shows unified front to Western governments
- Enables legitimate funding and support
- Provides political framework for resistance

**Requirement:**
Resistance groups must demonstrate they can work together and present capability before U.S. will commit support, especially if homeland attack occurs.

## Hamza bin Laden and the Islamic Army

### Hamza bin Laden: Background and Current Status

**Family:**
- Son of Osama bin Laden
- Brother: Abdullah bin Laden
- Wife: Daughter of Ayman al-Zawahiri (killed in operation that killed her father)

**Location History:**
- Spent most of time in Iran (harbored by Iranian government)
- January 2020: Left Iran after Qasem Soleimani's death
  - Reasoning: If Iran couldn't keep Soleimani safe, couldn't keep him safe
- 2020-2021: Pakistan (Waziristan)
- Post-Kabul fall (2021): Afghanistan
- 2022: Located in Kandahar
- Current: Afghanistan

**U.S. Government Position:**
- Officially lists Hamza as deceased
- $1 million reward (despite being overall Al-Qaeda leader)
- CIA actively suppressing information about him being alive
- CIA instructed U.S. press not to print stories about him being alive

**International Recognition:**
- British Intelligence leaked information to press that Hamza is alive
- Reason: British intelligence frustrated with CIA suppression efforts
- CIA attempted to curb both U.S. and British intelligence from discussing Hamza
- British press reported extensively (Mirror, Sun, others)
- Indian and African press covered the story
- U.S. press still won't publish (defer to CIA)

**FBI Reward Discrepancy:**
- Hamza bin Laden (overall leader): $1 million
- Hamza al-Ghamdi (his subordinate, Islamic Army commander): $5 million
- Demonstrates misplaced priorities and lack of understanding of command structure

### Differences from Osama bin Laden

**Operational Style:**
1. **Covert Operations:**
   - Prefers to remain completely hidden
   - No video appearances
   - No audio recordings
   - Wants "Hidden Hand" in all operations
   - Groups will not claim responsibility for attacks he plans

2. **Speed of Operations:**
   - Father took 5 years to approve 9/11
   - Hamza approves operations in single meeting
   - Example: Embassy attack plan - "brief it, I'm good, approved"
   - Iranian IRGC complaints: "Hamza is a loose cannon, moves too fast"
   - IRGC prefers working with Saif al-Adel: "more calm, cool, collected"

3. **Timeline:**
   - Osama: Patient, willing to take 1,000 years for caliphate
   - Hamza: Wants everything in his lifetime
   - Wants Islamic caliphate created during his life
   - Wants to fulfill all father's goals immediately

4. **Philosophy:**
   - Focused on bringing father's vision to reality
   - Primary goal: "Take it to America on U.S. soil"
   - Make Americans "feel the war zones at home"
   - Goes "full force" on homeland attacks

### The Islamic Army Concept

**Formation:**
- Created in last two years under Hamza's leadership
- Fulfills Osama bin Laden's original vision
- Now operational reality, not just aspiration
- Most significant development in global terrorism structure

**Composition:**
- **Sunni AND Shia groups** (breaking traditional sectarian divide)
- Al-Qaeda
- ISIS (including ISIS Khorasan Province)
- Taliban
- Hamas
- Hezbollah
- Iranian IRGC elements
- Any group willing to join

**Command Structure:**
- **Overall Leader:** Hamza bin Laden
- **Military Commander:** Hamza al-Ghamdi (former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden)
- Al-Ghamdi appointed by Hamza bin Laden
- Al-Ghamdi has higher FBI reward than his superior (organizational failure indicator)

**Training Numbers:**
- Approximately 120,000 people trained under Islamic Army umbrella
- New recruits train in various camps but emerge identified as "Islamic Army"
- When deployed (Syria, Somalia, Mali), fighters identify as Islamic Army
- If detained, they say "Islamic Army" not Al-Qaeda or ISIS

**Strategic Advantage:**
- Confuses intelligence collection
- Prevents accurate attribution of attacks
- Protects safe havens by avoiding direct responsibility
- Allows proxy operations through different groups

### Islamic Army Operations and Agreements

**Territorial Agreements:**
Al-Qaeda has given up desire to directly control territory, instead seeking political power and influence.

**ISIS Agreement:**
- Al-Qaeda conceded territorial control to ISIS
- ISIS can run parts of Syria and Iraq
- Al-Qaeda retains political influence
- Compromise allows both groups to focus on respective strengths

**Iran/IRGC Agreement:**
- Similar territorial/influence sharing arrangement
- Joint operations planning (October 7th example)
- Resource sharing
- Intelligence cooperation

**Lebanon Operations:**
- Al-Qaeda/Hezbollah joint plot against U.S. interests
- Only Hezbollah will claim responsibility
- Al-Qaeda involvement will remain hidden

**Syria Operations:**
- Al-Qaeda supported Jolani's blitz with 10,000 fighters
- Taliban provided training camps in Afghanistan
- No public acknowledgment of Al-Qaeda or Taliban involvement
- Media reports only HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) actions

### Goals and Strategy

**Primary Objectives (from Osama bin Laden's original goals):**

1. **Push U.S. out of Middle East:**
   - Embassy attacks
   - October 7th-style operations
   - Target: U.S. Embassy Baghdad specifically mentioned

2. **Restore the Caliphate:**
   - Syria operations
   - Mali operations
   - Full North Africa
   - Eventually Spain

3. **Economic Damage to West:**
   - Infrastructure targets
   - Transportation systems
   - Economic symbols

4. **Homeland Attacks:**
   - Bring war to American soil
   - Mass casualty events
   - Multiple simultaneous attacks

**Methodology:**
- Use all terrorist groups collectively
- Not just Al-Qaeda achieving goals
- Collaborative operations: Al-Qaeda + ISIS + whoever suitable
- Different groups claim responsibility
- Conceals true extent of coordination

**Compromise and Negotiation:**
Hamza constantly negotiating to bring groups into Islamic Army. Groups give up certain demands to join. Despite historical conflicts, finding common ground:
- Example: ISIS and Al-Qaeda historical enemies now cooperating
- Shia and Sunni groups working together
- All want same outcomes, just different methods

## October 7th Hamas Attacks

### Know Thy Enemy Investigation

**Background:**
- Sarah Adams' team not originally planning investigation
- Assumed Israel would claim attacks as Hamas-only and focus there
- Nearly one year after attack, Israel still not disclosing Al-Qaeda/Taliban involvement
- Israel struck IRGC targets but not Al-Qaeda or Taliban
- Adams' team realized if truth not revealed, U.S. law enforcement couldn't prepare
- Released investigation to inform U.S. first responders of attack tactics

**Investigation Sources:**
- Joint investigation by international team
- Open-source intelligence collection
- Reports from people on ground who passed intel to Israeli government
- Some sources provided Adams their reports they gave to Israel
- Used in October 7th investigation

**Key Finding:**
October 7th attacks were Al-Qaeda operation, not primarily Hamas. Hamas was the executing force, but planning, training, and coordination done by:
- Al-Qaeda
- Taliban
- Iranian IRGC
- Internal Iranian military units

### Planning Timeline and Key Dates

**Initial Planning:**
- **March 2022:** Planning began after Russia invaded Ukraine
- Terrorists believed world focus on Ukraine created opportunity
- Reached out to Russia for approval - Russia encouraged attack

**Original Target Date:**
- **October 7, 2022:** Initial planned date
- **Significance:** Anniversary of Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- October 7, 2001: George Bush announced operation and began carpet bombing Kandahar
- **This connects October 7th directly to Afghanistan**

**Delay:**
- July 31, 2022: U.S. drone strike killed Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul
- Al-Qaeda feared U.S. would bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Worried about losing their base/safe haven
- Reached out to Russia requesting they continue pressure for 2022 attack
- Russia wanted attack to happen to relieve Ukraine war pressure
- Al-Qaeda decided to delay to 2023

**Revised Timeline:**
- Attack delayed exactly one year
- Gave attackers additional year of training (beneficial)
- October 7, 2023: Attack executed

**Training Dates:**
- **August 7, 2022:** Training began
- **Significance:** Anniversary of 1998 Tanzania and Kenya embassy bombings
- Originally planned: 2 months training (August 7 - October 7, 2022)
- Actually received: Over 1 year training due to delay

### Planning Locations and Methods

**Primary Planning Meetings:**

1. **First Meeting: Kandahar, Afghanistan**
   - Key decision maker: Saif al-Adel (Al-Qaeda military commission head)
   - Chose the date: October 7th
   - Selected for Afghanistan connection

2. **Second Meeting: Kabul, Afghanistan**
   - Refinement of operational details

3. **Subsequent Planning:**
   - Primarily via Telegram
   - Demonstrates vulnerability in communications security
   - Should have been interceptable by intelligence services

**Training Location:**
- Afghanistan camps
- 1,500 fighters trained (originally planned 500 in 2 months)
- Additional time allowed more training and more fighters

### Key Participants and Roles

**Al-Qaeda:**
- Overall operational planning
- Saif al-Adel: Military commission leader, date selection
- Training camp provision
- Command and control

**Taliban:**
- **Hibatullah Akhundzada (Supreme Leader):** Issued fatwa authorizing attack
- Provided training camps
- Logistical support
- Coordination with other groups

**Iran/IRGC:**
- **Mohammad Kazemi:** Key plotter, operations coordinator
  - Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
  - Previously protected Al-Qaeda leaders in Iran
  - Also masterminding Soleimani assassination revenge plot
  - Not on FBI Most Wanted List (major intelligence failure)
- **Qasem Soleimani:** Planned before death, infrastructure he built used
- **Various IRGC generals:** Go-ahead authority for attack
- **Internal Iranian military units**
- Various Iranian government elements

**Hamas:**
- Ground execution force
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Received training in Afghanistan
- Took operational direction from Al-Qaeda/Taliban/Iran coordination

### Warning Signs and Intelligence Failures

**Information Provided to Israel:**
- People observed Hamas terrorists training in Afghanistan
- Reports provided to Israeli government before attack
- Israel knew Hamas was planning "some big plot" in Afghanistan
- No action taken

**Adams' Warning:**
"I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice about hey we're making the same mistake."

**Foreign Intelligence Confirmation:**
- European intelligence service contacted Adams through intermediary
- Message: "Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."
- Confirms foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question remains: Does U.S. government have it and not preparing America?

### Significance for U.S. Homeland Attacks

**October 7th as Template:**
- First in series of waves targeting Israel, Europe, and United States
- "Test run" for tactics to be used in U.S.
- Same planning structure
- Same coordination methods
- Same attack style being prepared for U.S.

**Training Correlation:**
- U.S. homeland attackers received similar training
- Advanced urban warfare
- Suicide bombing techniques
- Cover and covert operations
- Same camps, same instructors, same methods

**Tactics to Expect in U.S.:**
- Swarming attacks (multiple simultaneous targets)
- Combination of suicide bombers and "fedayeen" fighters
- Real-time intelligence and coordination
- Ability to change targets and tactics during operation
- Extended engagement (fighters will fight to death)
- Based on October 7th and 2008 Mumbai attacks

**The Afghanistan Connection:**
"Everybody who's like why do we care about Israel why is that our problem - that's just the first in the series that's coming for us. That's like the test run."

### Why Most Americans Don't Know

**U.S. Press:**
- Has not covered Al-Qaeda/Taliban involvement
- No major U.S. media reporting on October 7th's true origins
- Information available in British, European, Indian, African press
- Not in American media

**U.S. Government:**
- Not preparing American law enforcement
- Not sharing threat information
- Governor Ron DeSantis: "I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from the federal government"
- State and local law enforcement unaware

**Consequences:**
- First responders unprepared for tactics
- No training for October 7th-style attacks
- Cannot prepare defenses against known threats
- Same pattern as Israel before attack

### Date Significance Research

**October 7th (2001):**
- Operation Enduring Freedom announcement
- U.S. began carpet bombing Kandahar
- Direct Afghanistan connection most Americans and government don't recognize

**August 7th (1998):**
- Tanzania and Kenya embassy bombings
- Training for October 7th began on this anniversary

**September 11 (1922):**
Most Americans don't know why 9/11 was chosen:
- British Mandate began
- First time Westerner (British and Jewish) put in charge of Palestinian mandate
- Al-Qaeda cared about date from 1922
- Not about "school year starting" or "9-1-1" or "Allah"

**Implication:**
Terrorists choose dates based on historical significance to them, not to us. Many potential dates from:
- 20 years of Afghanistan/Iraq wars
- Syria war events
- Terrorist martyrs
- Historical grievances going back 100+ years

## Abbey Gate Investigation

### Official Investigation Failures

**CENTCOM Investigation:**
- Duration: 3.5 years
- Released: April 2024
- Investigators: 12-person panel
- Key failure: Report stated bomber was "Abdul Rahman al-Logari - that's a Kunya or an alias"
- **After 3.5 years, they never identified his true name**

**Sarah Adams' Investigation:**
- Started: April 2024 (when CENTCOM report released)
- Released: August 2024
- Duration: 4 months
- **Result: Found bomber's true name - Abdul Rahim Sangari**

**Other Cover-Ups:**
- Haqqani Network involvement concealed
- Presented as "lone wolf" Isis bomber
- Was actually coordinated attack between ISIS-K and Haqqani Network leadership

**Adams' Assessment:**
"If you actually know how to investigate and you look into it you can find all these holes. They did not do their job properly. They couldn't even find the true name of a man who blew up 13 of our service members. That's how little they cared."

### The True Nature of the Attack

**Not a Lone Wolf:**
- Coordinated attack with senior leadership
- ISIS Khorasan Province + Haqqani Network joint operation
- 12 terrorists identified in total:
  - 7 Haqqani Network members
  - 5 ISIS members

**The Bomber:**
- **True Name:** Abdul Rahim Sangari (not Abdul Rahman al-Logari)
- Released from Bagram prison: August 15, 2021
- In Kandahar operational planning meeting: August 18, 2021 (3 days after release)
- At Abbey Gate: August 26, 2021

### Timeline of Planning

**August 13, 2021:**
- U.S. announces Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO)
- Taliban and ISIS-K leadership learn of evacuation timeline

**August 15, 2021:**
- Abdul Rahim Sangari released from Bagram prison
- 2 days after NEO announcement

**August 18, 2021:**
- Sangari in Kandahar at operational planning meeting
- 3 days after his release
- Senior ISIS-K and Haqqani leadership present
- Attack planned in this meeting

**August 21, 2021:**
- Haqqani Network chooses three senior commanders
- Their role: Man the gates and allow bomber through

**August 23, 2021:**
- Taliban shift security forces from North Gate to Abbey Gate
- Deliberately concentrating forces where bombing planned
- Goal: Maximize casualties

**August 25, 2021:**
- U.S. issues threat warning about suicide bomber
- Warning came too late to change operations

**August 26, 2021:**
- Attack executed
- Over 170 Afghans killed
- 13 U.S. service members killed

**Timeline Summary:**
From announcement of NEO (August 13) to bomber in planning meeting (August 18) was only 5 days. From bomber's release to attack execution was 11 days.

### Operational Details

**Planning Location:**
- Kandahar, Afghanistan
- Same location used for October 7th Hamas attack planning
- ISIS-K and Haqqani Network senior leadership meeting

**Command and Control:**

**ISIS Khorasan Province:**
- **Leader:** Shahab al-Muhajir (at time) - later captured
- **New Leader:** Sultan Aziz Azam (aka "Sanaullah"/Sa'ad) - current
- Sa'ad Haqqani Network member since 2012
- Sa'ad was head of Haqqani Network in Kabul
- **Demonstrates Haqqani control of ISIS-K**

**Haqqani Network:**
- **Sirajuddin Haqqani:** Overall Haqqani leader, approved operation
- Three senior commanders at gates (names known to Adams but not fully disclosed)
- **Hafiz Zahir Hamidi:** Terrorist who told bomber "you're in a good spot now, blow"

**Security Manipulation:**
- Taliban (Haqqani Network) controlled all external security at Abbey Gate
- Deliberately concentrated forces at Abbey Gate
- Diverted security from North Gate
- Created target-rich environment
- Allowed bomber through their lines

**Movement of Personnel:**
Adams' team tracked:
- Who moved the suicide bomber to location
- Who moved Sanaullah (Sa'ad) to Kabul
- Location of planning meeting
- Three men at gates who facilitated
- Hafiz Zahir Hamidi who gave final detonation authorization

### U.S. Government Knowledge

**What U.S. Should Know:**
If Sarah Adams and her team can identify:
- Planning meeting location
- All participants
- Movement of bomber
- Movement of ISIS-K leader
- Identity of facilitators
- Timeline of operations

**Question:**
"If I can go find out where the planning meeting took place, I know who moved the suicide bomber, I know who moved [Sa'ad] to Kabul, I know who the three men were at the gates, and I know the terrorist his name is Hafiz [Zahir Hamidi] who told the bomber okay you're in a good spot now blow - I know all that on my own collecting on my own - how can the US government not collect that?"

**Two Possibilities:**
1. U.S. government did collect it and is covering up (dishonest to public)
2. U.S. government didn't collect it (profound intelligence failure)

**Adams' Conclusion:**
"If they aren't collecting it we got a lot more to worry about."

### What Public Was Told vs. Reality

**Official Narrative:**
- Lone wolf ISIS bomber
- Random attack
- Tragic but unpredictable event

**Reality:**
- Coordinated attack planned by two organizations
- 12 identified participants
- Planned in 5 days after NEO announcement
- Facilitated by Taliban/Haqqani security forces
- Taliban deliberately concentrated casualties
- Bomber specifically released from Bagram for operation

**Casualties:**
- 13 U.S. service members killed
- Over 170 Afghans killed
- Many more wounded

**Purpose of False Narrative:**
Making public think it was lone wolf bomber conceals:
- U.S. negotiating with attackers (Taliban/Haqqani)
- Haqqani Network's active role
- Speed and sophistication of terrorist planning
- Taliban's deliberate facilitation
- Intelligence failures in not detecting planning

**Adams' Assessment:**
"The US government made you believe this was a lone wolf. If I can go find out [all these details] how can the US government not collect that? And if they aren't collecting it we got a lot more to worry about."

## Al-Qaeda and Iran Relationship

### Historical Context

**Post-9/11 Flight:**
- When U.S. invaded Afghanistan (2001), senior Al-Qaeda leaders fled
- Two destinations: Pakistan and Iran
- Most did not stay in Afghanistan to fight

**Pakistan Path:**
- Pakistani government took U.S. money
- Began capturing terrorists
- Example: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed captured
- Result: Terrorists decided Pakistan unsafe

**Iran Path:**
- Terrorists and families relocated to Iran
- Lived there with wives and children
- Developed close relationships with Iranian government
- Safer haven than Pakistan

### Key Relationship: Qasem Soleimani

**Qasem Soleimani:**
- Head of Iranian Quds Force (IRGC special operations)
- Personally oversaw Al-Qaeda protection
- Created infrastructure to harbor terrorists
- Killed by U.S. drone strike January 2020 (ordered by President Trump)

**Mohammad Kazemi:**
- Close friend and colleague of Soleimani
- Tasked by Soleimani: Keep Al-Qaeda leaders safe
- Specifically protected:
  - Hamza bin Laden
  - Saif al-Adel
  - Benghazi plotter (how Adams' team knows this so well)

**Current Position:**
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization (not Quds Force head)
- One of most senior intelligence officials in Iran
- Still coordinating with Al-Qaeda
- Co-plotter of October 7th Hamas attacks
- Mastermind of Soleimani revenge plot (detailed separately)
- **Not on FBI Most Wanted List** (intelligence failure)

### Current Cooperation

**Intelligence Sharing:**
- 100% confirmed intelligence sharing between Taliban/Al-Qaeda and Iran
- Iranian government receives intelligence from terrorist groups
- Terrorists receive intelligence from Iran

**Intelligence Base in Afghanistan:**
- Located: Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Iranian government has intelligence base inside the camp
- Co-mingled operations

**Visitor Access to Kandahar:**
Regular visitors to Kandahar (meeting with each other AND Taliban):
- Iranians (IRGC)
- Russians
- Chinese
- North Koreans

**Coordination:**
- Mohammad Kazemi travels regularly to Afghanistan
- Co-planned October 7th attacks with:
  - Al-Qaeda leadership
  - Taliban leadership (including Hibatullah Akhundzada)
  - Hamas representatives
  - Iranian internal military units
- Ongoing operational planning for future attacks

### October 7th Coordination Details

**Planning Participants:**
- **Al-Qaeda:** Saif al-Adel and others
- **Taliban:** Hibatullah Akhundzada (issued fatwa)
- **Iran IRGC:** Mohammad Kazemi, various generals
- **Iranian Internal Units:** Various components
- **Hamas:** Operational representatives

**Approval Process:**
- Hibatullah Akhundzada issued religious fatwa for attack
- IRGC general gave final "go" order
- Demonstrates deep coordination across Sunni-Shia divide

**Logistics:**
- Iranian resources
- Afghan training camps
- Taliban approval and support
- Al-Qaeda planning and coordination
- Hamas execution

### Analyst Denialism

**Common Intelligence Assessment:**
"Iran doesn't get along with Al-Qaeda"
"Iran is attacking Al-Qaeda"

**Reality Check:**
- Iran harbored Al-Qaeda through entire Afghanistan War (2001-2021)
- Senior Al-Qaeda leadership lived in Iran safely for years
- Current ongoing operational coordination
- Joint planning of major attacks
- Intelligence sharing and bases

**Adams' Response:**
"What are you talking about? They harbored them almost the entire war we had."

**Why Analysts Wrong:**
- Outdated sectarian assumptions (Sunni vs. Shia)
- Failure to recognize ideological flexibility
- Not tracking actual relationships
- Ignoring evidence in front of them
- Relying on old frameworks

### Strategic Implications

**Unified Front:**
- Sunni and Shia terrorist groups cooperating
- State actors (Iran) and non-state actors (Al-Qaeda) aligned
- Breaks traditional Middle East conflict patterns
- Creates more dangerous threat environment

**Safe Haven:**
- Al-Qaeda had safe haven in Iran during U.S. war
- Now has safe haven in Afghanistan
- Iran provides additional security and support
- Allows long-term planning impossible without state protection

**Resource Sharing:**
- Iranian intelligence capabilities
- Al-Qaeda terrorist networks
- Taliban territory and training camps
- Combined: formidable capability

**Nuclear/Radiological Concerns:**
- Iran's nuclear program access
- Afghanistan's uranium mines
- Chinese involvement in uranium mines
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium use
- Not for nuclear weapons ("not exactly")
- Dirty bomb potential specifically mentioned

## Complex Terrorist Networks

### ISIS Khorasan Province - Two Branches

**Common Misunderstanding:**
Most people don't understand ISIS Khorasan Province has two separate branches with different origins, leadership, and backers.

**Branch One: Saif al-Muhajir/Sanaullah Branch**

**Leadership:**
- Current: Sanaullah (aka Sa'ad, Sultan Aziz Azam)
- Previous: Amjad Farooqi (Pakistani, captured)
- Sanaullah first Afghan to lead this branch

**Origins:**
- Emanated from Pakistani fighters
- Rawalpindi agency recruits
- FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas) region
- Punjabis
- Always led by Pakistani until Sanaullah

**Sanaullah's Background:**
- Member of Haqqani Network since 2012
- Was head of Haqqani Network in Kabul
- **This branch effectively controlled by Sirajuddin Haqqani**

**Major Operations:**
- Abbey Gate bombing (joint ISIS-K/Haqqani operation)
- Coordinated attacks in Kabul region

**Branch Two: Ghulam Kohistani Branch**

**Leadership:**
- Ghulam Kohistani

**Background:**
- Former Tajikistan Special Forces commander
- Defected to ISIS
- Became ISIS's Minister of War
- Death was faked
- Released after Kabul fell
- Now runs northern Afghanistan ISIS operations

**Base:**
- Northern Afghanistan
- Different from Branch One's operations

**Focus:**
- Central Asian terrorist recruitment
- Threats against Russia
- One of Russia's main global enemies

**Backing:**
- Supported by Sirajuddin Haqqani
- Given refuge in northern Afghanistan
- Funded by Haqqani Network

**Recruitment:**
- Gets many Central Asian fighters
- Uzbeks, Tajiks, other Central Asians
- Different ethnic composition than Branch One

### Russian and Taliban Relationship

**Moscow Attacks:**
- Executed by Branch One (Sanaullah's ISIS-K)
- Russia knows about this branch
- Russia working with Taliban against this branch

**The Ruse:**
- Real threat to Russia comes from Kohistani (Branch Two)
- Taliban hiding Kohistani's role from Russia
- Making Russia focus on Branch One
- **Taliban protecting actual threat while appearing to help Russia**

**Russia's Position:**
- Has to work with Taliban to collect on ISIS (like U.S. does)
- Unaware Taliban funding and protecting the branch actually threatening them
- Taliban playing both sides

**Why It Works:**
- Two branches appear separate
- Taliban can claim helping against one while supporting other
- Russia doesn't understand full picture
- Sirajuddin Haqqani controlling both but Russia thinks they're independent

### International Coordination in Kandahar

**Regular Visitors:**
- Russians
- Chinese
- North Koreans
- Iranians (IRGC)

**What They Do:**
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with each other
- Coordinate operations
- Share intelligence
- Plan collaborative efforts

**Intelligence Base:**
- Iranian government intelligence base inside Al-Qaeda camp in Kandahar
- Russian contacts and coordination
- Chinese presence (uranium mines and other interests)
- North Korean representatives

**Co-mingling:**
- State actors and non-state actors operating in same space
- Near-peer adversaries coordinating with terrorists
- Multiple agendas being pursued simultaneously
- All in Taliban-controlled territory

### Chinese Involvement

**Uranium Mines:**
- Afghanistan has significant uranium deposits (beyond lithium)
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- Mines "essentially owned and run by China"

**Presence in Mines:**
- Chinese personnel
- Al-Qaeda operatives
- IRGC representatives (helping Al-Qaeda)

**Purpose:**
- IRGC helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium applications
- Not nuclear weapons development ("not exactly")
- **Dirty bomb research and development**
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, and Al-Qaeda

**Long-term Strategy:**
- China viewing terrorists as potential proxies
- If U.S.-China war occurs, China will likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Longer game than Russia
- Building relationships and capabilities now

### Russian Involvement

**Ukraine War Connection:**
- October 7th planning began March 2022 (after Russia invaded Ukraine)
- Terrorists contacted Russia asking if timing okay
- Russia: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"
- Russia wanted attack to divert attention from Ukraine

**When Attack Delayed:**
- Zawahiri killed July 2022
- Al-Qaeda wanted to delay to 2023
- Reached back out to Russia
- Russia: "No, do it in 2022, don't wait, I need pressure off me for Ukraine"

**Current U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- Information suggests Russian pipeline helping bring supplies into U.S.
- Supplies for Al-Qaeda homeland attack
- Moving through Russian channels
- Into United States

**Russian Strategy:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- Use terrorists as proxies against U.S.
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS, not Russia
- No obvious Russian connection
- "Very smart of them"

**Near-Peer Conflict:**
- "We're in near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists"
- Some in U.S. think Sirajuddin Haqqani can be used against Russia
- Everyone playing game with terrorists
- Multiple sides trying to use same groups

### State Actor Assessment

**Iran:**
- Most deeply embedded
- Long-term relationships
- Infrastructure for support
- Active operational coordination
- Intelligence sharing

**Russia:**
- Tactical support for specific operations
- Supply chain support
- Using for Ukraine conflict advantage
- Playing Taliban for information on ISIS

**China:**
- Long-term strategic positioning
- Resource extraction (uranium, lithium)
- Building proxy potential
- Less immediate threat but growing

**North Korea:**
- Present in Kandahar
- Meetings with Taliban and others
- Specific activities less detailed
- Part of broader anti-U.S. coordination

**Combined Effect:**
- Multiple state actors supporting same terrorist networks
- Each for own purposes
- Creates much more capable and resilient terrorist capability
- Terrorists playing different states against each other
- Unprecedented level of coordination

**Power Dynamics:**
- "To them, they beat us"
- Al-Qaeda and Taliban seen as power players
- "People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country"
- Adversaries treating Taliban/Al-Qaeda with respect
- "What can you do for me, what can I do for you"

### Implications for U.S. Homeland Attack

**Supply Chain:**
- Russian channels helping move Al-Qaeda supplies into U.S.
- Chinese providing resources/access in Afghanistan
- Iranian intelligence and planning support
- Multiple state actors facilitating

**Plausible Deniability:**
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- No mention of Al-Qaeda
- Definitely no mention of state actor involvement
- Perfect cover for all participants

**Capability Enhancement:**
- State-level resources + terrorist motivation
- Intelligence services + terrorist networks
- Technology + extremist ideology
- More sophisticated than traditional terrorist attacks

---

## Homeland Attack Planning

### Confirmed Intelligence

**Number of Attackers:**
- Al-Qaeda claims: 1,000 trained and deployed for U.S. homeland attack
- Adams believes actual number may be higher
- Note: Hamas attack had 1,400-1,500 attackers (similar scale)

**Training Status:**
- All training completed
- Attackers deployed
- Training information now "old" (already done)
- Won't see new training information - it's finished

**Certainty Level:**
Adams' statement: "Al-Qaeda says they trained and deployed a thousand for this attack. I think there's more than a thousand Al-Qaeda members in the United States, but for the Homeland attack that number is based on what Al-Qaeda is saying."

### Training Details

**Three Primary Training Types:**

1. **Advanced Urban Warfare**
   - Extended training program
   - Tactics seen in Taliban training videos
   - High proficiency level
   - Multiple attackers going through same training

2. **Suicide Bombing Training**
   - Separate specialized camps
   - Approximately 20% of all camps do this training
   - "Invisible bomb vest" technology
   - Defeats magnetometers and K-9 detection

3. **Cover and Covert Operations**
   - Don't mention Afghanistan
   - Don't mention Al-Qaeda
   - Use fake names even in training camps
   - "If we're in camp together I don't know your name is Shawn Ryan. I know you as [fake name]."
   - Extensive operational security

**Training Camp Locations:**
- Afghanistan (primary)
- Adams' team identified three main camps with high confidence
- Specific locations not fully disclosed

**Operational Security:**
- Terrorists don't even know each other's real names
- Using pseudonyms within camps
- Prevents compromise if one captured
- Cannot identify others even if interrogated

### Entry into United States

**Southern Border Route (Primary for general terrorists):**
- Through Darien Gap
- Up through South/Central America
- Across U.S. southern border
- Fake documents:
  - Afghan passports (easiest to get)
  - Syrian passports
  - Turkish passports

**Challenge:**
- U.S. Border Patrol agents mostly haven't been overseas
- Can't identify fake documents or wrong nationalities
- Example: Egyptian with Syrian passport - will agent know?
- "Passport says Syrian" - passes through

**Legal Immigration (Al-Qaeda Preference):**
- "Clean" terrorists from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan
- Apply for legitimate tourist/travel visas
- Goal: "Embarrass system again like 9/11 attackers"
- Can fly directly to U.S.
- Legal status means less scrutiny
- Can wait indefinitely without raising suspicion

**Timeline Examples:**
- Fastest seen: Afghan leaving Afghanistan to U.S. border in 3 weeks
- Legal visa route: Can fly day after visa approved
- Depends on method and passport used

**Current Status:**
"They finished training and deployed them. Depending how they come through it could take different times. The fastest I've seen an Afghan leave Afghanistan and get over the border illegally is about 3 weeks. If you get a tourist visa and a Saudi's passport he can fly the day after he gets his visa."

### Attack Methodology: Mumbai Model

**Primary Template:** 2008 Mumbai attacks by Lashkar-e-Taiba

**Why This Model:**

1. **Swarming Attacks:**
   - Multiple targets simultaneously
   - Overwhelms response capabilities
   - Creates maximum chaos and fear

2. **Operational Flexibility:**
   - Attackers given latitude to change locations
   - Can change tactics (modus operandi)
   - Example: Mumbai train station supposed to be bombing
   - Terrorists saw more people, switched to shooting
   - Real-time decision making

3. **Real-Time Intelligence:**
   - Command center feeding information to attackers
   - What's on the news
   - What police are doing
   - Attackers adjust accordingly
   - Makes attack last longer
   - Mumbai: Extended over multiple days

4. **Extended Duration:**
   - Not hit-and-run
   - Sustained engagement
   - Maximum casualties over time
   - Maximum media coverage
   - Maximum terror impact

**October 7th Connection:**
October 7th attacks also based on Mumbai model. Same template being used.

### Fedayeen Fighters (Critical Concept)

**Definition:**
Fighters who fight to the death. Not exactly suicide bombers, but will continue until they or all enemies are dead.

**Significance for U.S.:**
- "We haven't had fedayeen attackers" in United States
- Americans don't understand this concept
- U.S. first responders not trained for this

**Combat Characteristics:**
- Fight for multiple days if necessary
- Will not surrender
- Apparent surrender may be deception
- May still have suicide vest
- Will detonate if guards lowered
- Requires different response tactics

**Training Level:**
"Remember their life is they train all the time. If that's all you're doing all day long I mean you're going to get really competent in it."

**Secondary Attacks:**
Example from Kabul bombing:
1. First bomber detonates
2. First responders move in
3. Second bomber walks in and detonates
4. Americans don't understand this is standard tactic

**Tactical Problem:**
- Battle ongoing
- Attacker appears to surrender
- Might have suicide vest
- First responders let guard down
- "That man came to die"
- Will fight until death or detonation
- "We can't let our guards down"
- Second and third order casualties from not understanding intent

### Suicide Bombers in U.S.

**Historical Context:**
- Never had significant suicide bombing in United States
- Only example: Nashville bomber (blew up car at AT&T building early morning, minimal casualties)
- That incident bizarre - deliberately avoided casualties

**Coming Attacks:**
- "We have not had a man walk up to a building with a suicide vest on in the United States"
- "Americans don't understand this"
- "Al-Qaeda knows this"

**Innovation:**
- "New and innovative" for American context
- Especially with invisible bomb vest
- Can walk inside buildings now (not just outside)
- No need to stay outside due to vest advancement

**Training:**
- Some attackers went through suicide bombing training specifically
- 20% of camps specialize in this
- Have the new vest technology
- Will be used in homeland attacks

### Mixed Force Composition

**Not Just Al-Qaeda:**
- 1,000 total attackers
- Mix of Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters
- ISIS fighters deliberately included
- Purpose: ISIS will claim responsibility

**Theory on Breakdown:**
- More fighter types: ISIS
  - If caught, claim "I'm ISIS"
  - Directs attention away from Al-Qaeda
- More suicide bombers: Al-Qaeda
  - Cannot be interrogated after detonation
  - Protects organizational security

**Attribution Strategy:**
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- U.S. intelligence will support ISIS attribution
- Taliban has been feeding U.S. intel on ISIS attackers for years
- After attack: U.S. will search databases
- Will find: "Yeah we had pieces on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers in system already identified as ISIS
- "That's how well they've planned this"

### Target Selection

**Al-Qaeda Preferences:**

1. **Symbolic Targets:**
   - U.S. Capitol (specifically mentioned)
     - In Al-Qaeda propaganda since 9/11
     - In memorials of 9/11
     - High symbolic value
   - National monuments
   - Government buildings

2. **Economic Targets:**
   - Bridges (specifically mentioned)
   - Public transportation (metro systems mentioned)
   - Infrastructure causing economic damage
   - Transportation hubs

3. **Mass Casualty Locations:**
   - Places that cause fear
   - Economic impact sites

**ISIS Preferences:**
- "Just wants mass casualty"
- Softer targets
- Wherever most people are
- Opportunity-driven

**Tactical Flexibility:**
Example scenario:
- ISIS terrorist assigned to DC Metro
- Goes down, sees only 20 people
- Sees event happening above ground with hundreds
- Changes target to event
- Authorized to make this decision in real time

**Soft Targets (Shawn Ryan's Assessment):**
Given terrorist preferences and flexibility:
- Universities
- Churches
- Stadiums
- Farmers markets
- Schools
- Shopping centers
- Any high-density civilian location

### Coordination and Timing

**"Coordinated" Attacks:**
Unclear what this means exactly:
- All same time?
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (five straight days)?
- U.S. and Europe simultaneously?
- Different cities in U.S. at same time?

**Multiple Interpretation Scenarios:**

1. **U.S. Only:**
   - Multiple cities
   - Same time or sequential days
   - Sustained operation

2. **U.S. and Europe:**
   - Simultaneous attacks on both continents
   - Same day/time
   - Maximum global impact

3. **Sequential Waves:**
   - Day 1: City A
   - Day 2: City B
   - Day 3: City C
   - Sustained terror over week

**What's Known:**
- Attacks will be "coordinated"
- Exact definition unclear
- Could mean any of above scenarios
- All involve multiple simultaneous locations at some level

### Scale Comparison

**October 7th (Israel):**
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Single concentrated area
- Massive casualties and destruction

**U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- 1,000+ attackers claimed
- Multiple cities
- Potentially much larger geographic area
- Extended duration planned

**Europe Attack:**
- Separate 1,000 attackers
- Separate training
- Separate deployment
- Simultaneous or sequential with U.S.

**Casualty Estimates:**
Scott Mann reportedly told Shawn Ryan: Al-Qaeda predicting 50,000-60,000 American deaths. (Adams did not confirm specific number but confirmed scale of planning)

### What Makes This Different

**Innovations:**
1. Invisible bomb vests defeating security
2. Fedayeen fighters (new to U.S. context)
3. Real-time intelligence and flexibility
4. Swarming multiple locations
5. Extended duration engagements
6. Mix of tactics (bombing, shooting, holding positions)

**Sophistication:**
- State-level support (Iran, Russia, China)
- Multi-year planning
- Extensive training
- Operational security
- Strategic deception (ISIS attribution)
- Pre-planted intelligence in U.S. databases

**Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
- No preparation by federal government
- State/local law enforcement uninformed
- First responders untrained for these tactics
- Public completely unaware
- Open borders allowing entry
- Visa system allowing legal entry

### Timeline

**Training:** Completed over past year+

**Entry:** Ongoing/completed (Adams believes many already in U.S.)

**Planned Execution:** 2025

**Adams' Assessment:**
"I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both."

**Caveat:**
Israel attack planned for 2022, executed 2023 (pushed one year). If U.S. attack doesn't happen in 2025, doesn't mean intelligence was wrong - could be delayed. Risk: People let guard down if doesn't happen on expected timeline.

### Intelligence Pre-Planting

**The Setup:**
- Taliban feeding information to U.S. government for years
- Small pieces on individual ISIS-K terrorists
- Entering U.S. intelligence databases
- Creating paper trail

**After Attack:**
- U.S. will search databases
- Will find prior intelligence on attackers
- "Yeah we had a little piece on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers will have similar database entries
- All pointing to ISIS

**Result:**
- U.S. intelligence will confirm "It's an ISIS attack"
- Will not recognize Al-Qaeda
- Will not recognize Taliban involvement
- Will not recognize state actor involvement (Russia, Iran, China)
- Attribution completely wrong, but supported by years of planted intelligence

**Adams:** "That's how well they've planned this."

### Warning Signs Being Ignored

**Information Flow:**
- People passed information about Hamas training in Afghanistan to Israel
- Israel ignored it
- Israel knew "Hamas was planning some big plot" in Afghanistan
- October 7th happened

**Current Situation:**
- Same types of reports being passed to U.S. government
- About Al-Qaeda training for U.S. attacks
- U.S. not taking seriously
- Same pattern as Israel

**Adams' Warning:**
"I worry because same things are being passed to our government and they're not taking it serious right. I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice right about hey we're making the same mistake."

## Training and Preparation for Attacks

### Training Capacity and Timeline

**Overall Numbers:**
- October 7th (Israel): 1,500 fighters
- U.S. Homeland: 1,000 fighters
- Europe: 1,000 fighters
- Syria deployment: 10,000 fighters
- **Total: Approximately 13,500 trained in recent operations**
- Islamic Army total: Approximately 120,000 trained overall

**Timeline Factors:**
Training duration depends on:
1. Number of attackers
2. Camp capacity
3. Type of training required
4. Ethnic/national groupings
5. Concurrent operations

**October 7th Example:**
- Originally planned: 500 fighters, 2 months (August-October 2022)
- Actually executed: 1,500 fighters, 14+ months (August 2022-October 2023)
- Delay due to Zawahiri killing improved training quality

**Syria Deployment:**
- 10,000 fighters
- Took priority for period
- "Gets completely ignored"
- Recently completed, now active in Syria
- Some went to Iraq as well

**U.S. Homeland:**
- 1,000 fighters
- Training completed over past year+
- All deployed
- Mixed with Syria training timeline

### Camp Infrastructure

**Organization Methods:**

**By Ethnicity:**
- Some camps don't mix Libyans with Somalians or Syrians
- Arabs vs. non-Arabs sometimes separated
- Helps maintain operational security
- Reduces ethnic tensions

**By Training Type:**
- Suicide bombing: 20% of camps specialize
- Advanced urban warfare: Dedicated camps
- Cover and covert operations: Specialized training
- Mixed general training: Other camps

**By Organization:**
- Traditionally: Al-Qaeda camps, ISIS camps, etc.
- Now: "Islamic Army" umbrella
- Recruits emerge identified as Islamic Army
- Creates attribution confusion for intelligence services

### Advanced Training Observed

**Taliban Training Video:**
- Posted publicly showing capabilities
- "Wellone YouTube video of skills"
- Shawn Ryan: "That scared the shit out of me"
- Professional level tactics
- Multiple skills demonstrated
- Team coordination
- Weapon proficiency

**Note:** That video was Taliban camps. Cannot get video from Al-Qaeda camps (phones banned from Al-Qaeda camps). Al-Qaeda training considered even higher level than Taliban.

**Key Point:**
"Remember their life is they train all the time. If that's all you're doing all day long I mean you're going to get really competent in it. And then they have different emotions behind it too and you know different beliefs and the religion behind it too which makes you more devout."

### Operational Security Training

**Cover Identity:**
- Tell no one about Afghanistan
- Never mention Al-Qaeda
- If Saudi or Kuwaiti, maintain civilian cover
- No discussion of camps or training

**Fake Names in Training:**
- All trainees use pseudonyms in camp
- Example: "If we're in camp together I don't know your name is Shawn Ryan. I know you as [fake name]."
- Prevents identification if one captured
- Cannot compromise others

**Long-term Placement:**
- Prefer legal entry to U.S.
- Can wait months or years
- Legal status doesn't raise alarms
- Build normal-appearing life
- Activate when ordered

### Camp Visitor Programs

**Family Integration:**
Al-Qaeda learned from previous mistakes about generational planning.

**Old Problem:**
- Focused on first generation
- Didn't train second/third generation
- When U.S. drone strikes eliminated leaders, replacements inadequate
- "Third and fourth string of external operations sucked"

**New Approach:**
- Encourage marriage
- Bring in women from fighter's home country
  - Syrian fighter? Bring Syrian women
  - Don't force marriage to Afghans
- Create "whole Jihadi family"
- Train the children
- Multi-generational commitment

**Support Structure:**
- Housing provided
- Weapons provided
- Training provided
- Financial stipend
- Marriage arrangement assistance
- Education for children in ideology
- Complete social safety net

**Terrorist Testimony:**
From documentary "Jihad Rehab":
- Filmmaker asked former Al-Qaeda member: "Was life easier in Afghanistan?"
- Answer: "Yes"
- Reason: Complete social safety net provided
- Everything taken care of
- Focus entirely on jihad and training

**Long-term Goal:**
"We're never going to have that failure again where the second generation can't step up."

### Recruitment Demographics

**Primary Sources:**
- Afghanistan
- Pakistan
- Syria
- Libya
- Somalia
- Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan)
- Arab countries (Saudi, Kuwait, Jordan)
- North Africa

**Recruitment Volume:**
"There is no lack of bodies. There's no lack of terrorist volunteering."

**Why So Many Recruits:**

1. **Social Safety Net:**
   - Complete life support
   - Housing, food, stipend
   - Marriage assistance
   - Family support

2. **Purpose and Belonging:**
   - Religious framework
   - Brotherhood
   - Clear mission and goals

3. **Training and Weapons:**
   - Professional military training
   - Access to weapons
   - Skills development
   - Prestige in community

4. **Ideology:**
   - Religious duty
   - Martyrdom ideology
   - Anti-Western sentiment
   - Various personal motivations

**Documentary Example:**
"Jihad Rehab" showed four Al-Qaeda terrorists in Saudi rehabilitation program. Each had different reason for joining:
- Personal grievance
- Religious calling
- Social reasons
- Economic necessity

Al-Qaeda targets all these motivations in recruitment.

### Syria Operations Completion

**Recent Deployment:**
- 10,000 fighters sent to Syria (some to Iraq)
- Julani's blitz attack supported by these fighters
- Taliban provided training camps
- Recently completed operations
- Media only reported HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham)
- No mention of Al-Qaeda or Taliban involvement

**Current Status:**
- Fighting continues (Kurds, others)
- May redeploy to:
  - Iraq (caliphate wave)
  - Africa: Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso (caliphate wave)
- Unlikely to come to U.S. (different wave, different training)

**Wave Organization:**
- Syria fighters are "caliphate wave"
- Trained specifically for territorial control
- Different skill set than homeland attackers
- Doesn't make sense to mix them
- Enough bodies for all operations simultaneously

### Training vs. Current Status

**What's Already Done:**
- U.S. homeland attacker training: Complete
- Europe attacker training: Complete
- Syria deployment training: Complete
- October 7th training: Complete (attack executed)

**What's Ongoing:**
- Embassy attack operational planning
- Homeland attack positioning and preparation
- Caliphate expansion (Africa, Middle East)

**Intelligence Implications:**
"All the training info is now old because they trained all the homeland attackers. If that makes sense, like next week you're not going to get info of a homeland attacker probably at a terrorist camp because it's already done."

Current intelligence is about:
- Movement and positioning
- Operational planning
- Target selection
- Timing decisions
- Not training (that's finished)

## State-Level Response

### Florida - Governor Ron DeSantis

**Initial Briefing:**
- Sarah Adams and Scott Mann met with Governor DeSantis
- Briefed him on Al-Qaeda homeland attack planning
- DeSantis statement: **"I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from the federal government"**
- Zero federal information sharing to state level

**Immediate Actions Taken:**

**Day After Briefing:**
- Briefed every sheriff in State of Florida
- Told them: "There's a potential threat"
- Created information sharing mechanism
- Direct line between Adams' team and Governor's office

**Information Sharing System:**
- Adams can contact DeSantis's people immediately
- If threat info found
- If actionable intelligence discovered
- Allows state-level response

**Long-term Preparation:**

**Florida National Guard (FNG):**
- Existed before Al-Qaeda threat briefing
- DeSantis already positioning state for counterterrorism capability
- Different legal authorities than regular National Guard
- Trained as counterterrorism force
- Capabilities comparable to federal CT units
- Can respond faster than federal agencies in emergency
- Force multiplier for law enforcement

**Structure:**
- Professional training
- Proper equipment
- Legal authorities for CT operations within state
- Can coordinate with law enforcement
- More trained bodies for rapid response

**Strategic Vision:**
- State-level capability independent of federal government
- Doesn't exist in other states
- DeSantis saw need before Al-Qaeda briefing
- Now positioned perfectly for threat

**Adams' Summary:**
"He has positioned the State of Florida to basically have a force that is a force multiplier against counterterrorism. This doesn't really exist in other states. He was already preparing something like this and he now has a force with the capabilities that at least can respond along with law enforcement. You'll have more trained bodies to deal with this faster in an emergency."

### Potential Tennessee Response

**Shawn Ryan's Concern:**
Lives in Tennessee, concerned about state preparedness.

**Idea:**
- Have DeSantis speak with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee
- Establish similar capability in Tennessee
- Tennessee also has large Special Operations veteran community
- Same model could work

**Shawn Ryan:**
"I wonder if there's a way to get DeSantis to have a chat with Bill Lee the governor of Tennessee to start standing something up like that because I thought that was genius."

**Rationale:**
- Many retired Special Operations personnel in Tennessee
- Similar demographics to Florida
- Same vulnerability to attacks
- "Why would you not do that at this point especially with the way the federal government is, the border wide open?"

**Follow-up Action:**
Shawn Ryan planning to:
- Create social media clip about Florida model
- Target Governor Bill Lee specifically
- Try to get his attention
- Promote state-level response model

### Federal Government Failure

**Information Sharing:**
- Zero threat reporting to states (per DeSantis)
- No information to local law enforcement
- No information to first responders
- No training recommendations
- No preparation guidance

**Budget and Training Implications:**
Adams: "At least if you say a threat's coming and the government puts out something it gives you a catalyst or it gives you something to hold on to right. You can go and say we need more training, we haven't even done this type of training in six years. You can start having the discussions."

**Current Reality:**
- Most law enforcement never heard Al-Qaeda planning U.S. attack
- No special training conducted
- No budget allocated
- No preparation occurring
- "Most of the country have never heard Al-Qaeda's planning an attack here"

**Adams' Frustration:**
"Anyone who's like yeah this is all happening behind the scenes don't worry everyone's prepared our law enforcement knows - most of the country have never heard Al-Qaeda's planning an attack here."

### State Authority and Capability

**Why States Matter:**
- Federal government not functioning on this issue
- States have authorities within borders
- Can train law enforcement
- Can allocate resources
- Can create specialized units
- Can share information locally

**Legal Framework:**
- State National Guard has authorities regular NG doesn't
- Can operate within state
- Can coordinate with local law enforcement
- Constitutional authorities
- Not dependent on federal approval for state operations

**Resource Mobilization:**
- Special Operations veteran community
- Law enforcement experience
- Intelligence community retirees
- Willing population
- State budgets

### Call to Action for Other States

**Adams' Recommendation:**
"States need to take a look at this. The federal government - hopefully that changes come January 20th - but right now it's not functioning. States better start getting involved."

**Model Available:**
- Florida has done it
- Model can be replicated
- Legal framework exists
- Training protocols available
- Someone should come on show and explain FNG in detail

**Adams' Note:**
"You really should have someone come on because my summary of the Florida National Guard was probably horrible and they're probably going to watch this and be like she doesn't even know what we do right we do way more than that. You should have someone come on and actually talk about it because I think it would be interesting for people to see hey there are the models out there people are being creative and innovative on this."

### What States Should Do

**Immediate:**
1. Request briefings from Adams' team or similar sources
2. Brief all sheriffs and law enforcement leadership
3. Establish information sharing systems
4. Assess current capabilities

**Short-term:**
1. Specialized training for law enforcement
   - Fedayeen fighter tactics
   - Suicide bomber response
   - Swarming attack response
   - Mumbai-style scenarios
2. Create or enhance counterterrorism units
3. Coordinate with military veteran community
4. Develop rapid response protocols

**Long-term:**
1. Establish State National Guard CT capability (like Florida)
2. Ongoing intelligence sharing networks
3. Regular training and exercises
4. Public awareness (appropriate level)
5. Coordinate with neighboring states

### The Federal Vacuum

**What Should Happen:**
- DHS threat assessments distributed
- FBI intelligence sharing
- Federal training programs
- Resource allocation
- Coordination with states

**What Is Happening:**
- Nothing
- Zero threat reporting
- No information sharing
- No training
- No preparation
- States on their own

**Why State Action Essential:**
"Come to save you? The federal government? The machine is no longer working. You better take matters into your own hands."

## IRGC and Soleimani Plot

### Background: Qasem Soleimani

**Who He Was:**
- Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) General
- Head of Quds Force (special operations/external operations branch)
- Considered military general of foreign government
- U.S. wouldn't normally target such officials

**Significance to Iran:**
"Qasem Soleimani isn't just a man in Iran to Iran - he was the symbol of the Iranian Revolution. He's like I don't know our Capitol or our Statue of Liberty - he's bigger than a man."

**Death:**
- January 2020
- U.S. drone strike in Iraq
- Ordered by President Donald Trump
- Trump put lethal authorities in place specifically to allow targeting

**Iranian Perspective:**
- Blame Trump "almost solely" for death
- Trump approved the operation
- Trump got authorities in place
- Trump personally authorized
- Symbol of revolution destroyed

### The "Soleimani Plot"

**U.S. Government Assessment:**
- Plot against President Trump (former president)
- Assassination attempt
- Iranian revenge for Soleimani killing

**Mastermind:**
**Mohammad Kazemi**
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
- Previously protected Al-Qaeda leaders for Soleimani
- Plotted October 7th Hamas attacks
- Now plotting Trump assassination
- **Not on FBI Most Wanted List**

**Discovery:**
Adams' team discovered while investigating October 7th. Same person central to both operations.

**Budget:**
**$145 million per month**

**Adams' Assessment:**
"You don't assassinate a president with $145 million a month. There's more to this plot."

### Scale and Scope Questions

**The Money Problem:**
- $145 million monthly far exceeds assassination costs
- Even elaborate security penetration doesn't require this
- Suggests much larger operation

**Possible Scenarios:**

1. **Trump Plus Other Targets:**
   - Multiple high-value individuals
   - Simultaneous operations
   - Symbolic targets beyond one person

2. **Major Infrastructure:**
   - U.S. Capitol mentioned as possibility
   - "Maybe it's the Capitol, the entire Capitol"
   - "The building"
   - National symbols

3. **Equivalent Response:**
   - Soleimani was "symbol of Iranian Revolution"
   - Not just a man
   - Equal response must match symbolic value
   - One man assassination insufficient

**Iranian Doctrine:**
- Always strike equivalent target
- Eye for eye principle
- "If you hit their embassy, they hit your embassy"
- "If you kill their scientist, they do assassination"
- Kill Soleimani = kill equivalent figure or symbol

**Adams' Theory:**
"I do think U.S. might be underestimating how the Iranians view Qasem Soleimani and I think that the response to him is going to be bigger than they're assessing. I don't think it's just going to be the assassination of one man."

### Trump as Target

**Why Trump:**
- Ordered the strike
- Got legal authorities in place
- Personally approved operation
- Made decision to kill Iranian symbol
- Iran holds him directly responsible

**Even if Not President:**
- Plot began when Trump was former president
- Still masterminded by Kazemi
- Still major Iranian operation
- Now Trump is president-elect/president
- Raises stakes considerably

**Security Concerns:**
- Large budget suggests sophisticated operation
- May involve multiple attempts
- May include other targets
- May be larger symbolic attack

### Mohammad Kazemi Details

**Current Position:**
- Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
- One of most senior intelligence officials in Iran
- Not Quds Force head (different position)

**History:**
- Close friend and colleague of Soleimani
- Tasked by Soleimani to protect Al-Qaeda leaders
- Protected Hamza bin Laden in Iran
- Protected Saif al-Adel
- Protected Benghazi plotters

**Current Activities:**
- Masterminding Trump assassination plot
- Co-planned October 7th Hamas attacks
- Travels regularly to Afghanistan
- Coordinates with Taliban and Al-Qaeda
- Active operational role

**Intelligence Failure:**
- Not on FBI Most Wanted List
- Minimal U.S. recognition
- "He's the Mastermind behind a plot against a former US president - he's not even on our Wanted list"
- U.S. counterterrorism "has just gone off the rails"

### Lack of U.S. Response

**No Contact:**
After Adams published findings:
- No U.S. government agency contacted her team
- No requests for information
- No follow-up questions
- No apparent investigation
- Published in October 7th report
- Publicly available
- Ignored

**Why This Matters:**
- Foreign intelligence found the information credible (European service confirmed)
- Open source investigation found mastermind
- U.S. government apparently hasn't
- Or worse: knows and not acting
- Threat to current president

**Two Possibilities:**

1. **Lucky Find:**
   "There's a potential we got lucky and we found the Mastermind before the US government"

2. **Willful Ignorance:**
   U.S. knows but not prioritizing

**Either Way:**
Major intelligence and security failure regarding threat to president.

### Resources and Attribution

**Where Money Goes:**
- Assassination planning
- Other operations (unspecified with that budget)
- Possibly infrastructure attack preparation
- Possibly multiple target operations
- Possibly symbolic attack on scale of Capitol

**Attribution:**
- U.S. government publicly calls it plot against Trump
- Budget suggests much more
- Iran won't claim responsibility (maintains plausible deniability)
- May coordinate with other operations
- May time with Al-Qaeda attacks (maximum chaos)

### Strategic Implications

**Timing Concerns:**
- Al-Qaeda homeland attack planned for 2025
- Soleimani plot active
- Both Iranian-connected
- Potential for coordination
- Maximum impact on U.S.

**Iran's Larger Strategy:**
- Work with Al-Qaeda (October 7th proven)
- Work with Taliban (October 7th proven)
- Revenge for Soleimani
- Weaken U.S. globally
- Show capability

**Vulnerability:**
- President-elect becoming president
- Transition period
- Known target
- Sophisticated, well-funded plot
- State-level resources
- Intelligence organization directing

## Role of China and Russia

### China in Afghanistan

**Lithium and Uranium:**
- Afghanistan has significant lithium deposits (widely known)
- Also has significant uranium deposits (less discussed)
- Chinese have negotiated mining rights since before U.S. withdrawal

**Uranium Mines:**
- At least two provinces in southern Afghanistan
- "Essentially owned and run by China"
- Chinese personnel on site
- Active mining operations

**Co-location with Terrorists:**
- Al-Qaeda operatives present at uranium mines
- IRGC representatives present
- Iranian helping Al-Qaeda with uranium applications
- "Same building" - Chinese, Iranian, Al-Qaeda together

**Purpose of IRGC Presence:**
Helping Al-Qaeda explore uranium use - "not exactly" for nuclear weapons, but for dirty bombs.

**Strategic Concerns:**
- China, Iran, Al-Qaeda collaborating on radiological weapons
- Chinese aware and allowing it
- May be providing resources or expertise
- "Think of that as they innovate on that and grow"

### China's Long Game

**Current Assessment:**
- "A little more of a longer game"
- Not immediate threat like Russia
- Building relationships now
- Positioning for future

**Meetings in Kandahar:**
- Chinese representatives regularly visit
- Meet with Taliban leadership
- Meet with other state actors present
- Building relationships and agreements

**Proxy Potential:**
"China is meeting with the terrorists. The place I have an issue with China is I do think China is going to find a way to use the terrorists as proxies."

**Future Scenario:**
- If U.S.-China war occurs
- China will likely use terrorists against U.S.
- Infrastructure already being built
- Relationships being established
- Resources being positioned

**Not Immediate:**
- U.S. homeland attack appears primarily Al-Qaeda/Iran/Russia supported
- China more background role currently
- But building capability for future

### Russia and Ukraine War

**October 7th Connection:**

**March 2022:**
- Russia invades Ukraine (February 2022)
- Terrorists begin planning October 7th (March 2022)
- Terrorists contact Russia: "Is timing okay?"
- Russia: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"
- Russia wanted distraction from Ukraine

**July 2022:**
- U.S. kills Zawahiri
- Al-Qaeda wants to delay attack to 2023
- Fears U.S. will bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Contacts Russia about delay

**Russia's Response:**
"No, do it in 2022, don't wait. I need pressure off me for my war in Ukraine."

**Result:**
- Al-Qaeda delayed anyway (their decision)
- But shows Russia actively encouraging attacks
- Russia viewing terrorists as useful
- Willing to sacrifice others' security for Ukraine advantage

### Russia and U.S. Homeland Attack

**Supply Chain Support:**

**Adams' Statement:**
"There is information that Russia and Russian pipelines are helping bring in some of the resources that are going to support Al-Qaeda's Homeland attack."

**Clarification:**
"Their pipeline is helping move some of Al-Qaeda's supplies into the United States for the Homeland attack."

**Purpose:**
- Counter U.S. support for Ukraine
- "Push at us for Ukraine just like we're doing stuff against Russia"
- Asymmetric response
- Use terrorists as proxies

**Type of Supply:**
Adams knows what specific supplies (stated "I'll tell you what the supply is") but did not fully disclose in interview for security reasons.

**Strategic Logic:**
- Al-Qaeda will pull off attack
- Will be blamed on ISIS
- No one will call it Al-Qaeda
- "Definitely no one's going to say Russia played a piece in it"
- Perfect deniability
- "Very smart of them"

### Russia and ISIS-K

**Moscow Attack:**
- ISIS Khorasan Province (Branch One - Sanaullah's branch)
- Russia aware of this threat
- Working with Taliban against ISIS-K

**The Deception:**
- Real threat to Russia: Branch Two (Ghulam Kohistani in north)
- Taliban hiding this from Russia
- Making Russia focus on Branch One
- Sirajuddin Haqqani funding and protecting Branch Two
- Russia doesn't understand full picture

**Russia's Vulnerability:**
- Has to work with Taliban to collect intelligence on ISIS
- "Just like we do"
- Taliban playing both sides
- Giving Russia information on one branch
- Hiding the branch actually threatening them

### Near-Peer Competition and Terrorists

**Current State:**
"We're in near-peer and near-peer has gotten smart about using terrorists."

**Multiple Players:**
- U.S. thinks it can use Sirajuddin Haqqani against Russia
- Russia using terrorists against U.S.
- China positioning for future use
- Iran actively coordinating operations
- "Everybody's playing this game with the terrorists now"

**The Problem:**
- Everyone thinks they're manipulating terrorists
- Terrorists playing all sides
- Getting resources from multiple state actors
- Building capability beyond any single sponsor
- More sophisticated and dangerous than ever

**Taliban as Power Players:**
"Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are power players. People think oh Afghanistan's a third world country - they're not being treated a third world country by our enemies. They're treating them with respect. They're saying what can you do for me, what can I do for you."

### Dirty Games Around Ukraine War

**U.S. Actions:**
- Likely funding some terrorists as proxies against Russia
- Trying to use Taliban/Haqqani elements
- "We're doing things to counter Russia in likely funding terrorists"

**Russian Actions:**
- Funding terrorists against U.S.
- Supply chain support for homeland attack
- "Russia's doing the same thing"

**Mutual Escalation:**
- Both sides using terrorists
- Both sides thinking they're winning
- Both vulnerable to blowback
- Terrorists benefiting from all sides

**Adams' Warning:**
"To not think they're [Russia] trying to also undercut us and also get on the side of our enemy and hit us with our enemy... It's very smart of them."

### Combined State Actor Support

**For U.S. Homeland Attack:**

**Russia:**
- Supply chain support
- Moving resources into U.S.
- Direct logistical support

**Iran:**
- Intelligence and planning (Kazemi)
- Coordination with Al-Qaeda
- IRGC resources
- Operational support

**China:**
- Resources in Afghanistan (uranium)
- Meeting with terrorists
- Building long-term relationships
- Possibly future direct support

**North Korea:**
- Present in Kandahar
- Meetings with terrorists and other state actors
- Specific role less detailed
- Part of anti-U.S. coordination

**Effect:**
- Multiple state actors supporting same operation
- Each has plausible deniability
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- No state actor will be implicated
- Near-perfect operational security
- Unprecedented coordination level

### Strategic Assessment

**What This Means:**
- Terrorists have state-level resources
- Multiple states providing different capabilities
- Coordination happening in Afghanistan (Kandahar)
- All meeting with each other and Taliban
- Creating much more sophisticated threat
- Beyond traditional terrorist capability

**Implications for Response:**
- Taking out terrorist leadership insufficient
- State sponsors must be addressed
- Multiple state actors complicates response
- Attribution will be deliberately wrong
- U.S. will blame ISIS
- Real sponsors hidden

**Long-term Concern:**
- This model will continue
- States finding terrorists useful
- Terrorists playing states against each other
- Everyone thinks they're using terrorists
- Terrorists may be using everyone
- Building independent capability with state resources

## Intelligence Collection Failures

### Loss of Assets

**Afghanistan Withdrawal:**
- CIA and military pulled out completely
- All assets abandoned
- Intelligence collection dropped to near zero

**Scott Mann's Assessment:**
"The Allies we abandoned hate the CIA. They hate huge parts of the military except maybe their one friend."

**Current Reality:**
- Former assets collecting information
- Won't share with U.S.
- Will share with Israel instead
- "We'll never pass it to the United States"

**Why:**
- Betrayal during withdrawal
- Abandonment
- No protection provided
- Families killed
- No trust remaining

### Specific Example: Phone Number

**CIA Asset Abandoned:**

**The Promise:**
- CIA gave asset a phone number
- Told to call when reaching Kabul airport
- "We'll get you evacuated"

**What Happened:**
- One-way number
- Goes to voicemail answering service
- No human ever answers
- Asset called repeatedly
- No one ever called back

**Final Betrayal:**
"Then one day they turned it off. He had no way to ever re-contact them again. They shut off the damn phone number."

**Result:**
- Asset stranded in Afghanistan
- Under Taliban control
- CIA has no way to reconnect
- Even if wanted to, burned the bridge
- Impossible to rebuild trust

### Rebuilding Intelligence Networks

**The Problem:**
"How do you build completely new relationships with nobody? You didn't even give me the respect to give me a number I could call once or twice a year."

**What's Required:**
- New relationships from scratch
- In hostile environment
- With zero footprint
- With people who hate you
- Who have no reason to trust you

**Current Capability:**
- "99% of intelligence collection" lost (Adams' estimate)
- Rely on Taliban for information (enemies)
- Cannot verify anything
- No independent sources
- No way to rebuild quickly

### CIA's Suppression of Information

**Hamza bin Laden Example:**

**British Intelligence:**
- Knows Hamza is alive
- Running Al-Qaeda
- Planning major operations
- Leaked to British press to force issue

**CIA Response:**
- Actively suppressing information
- Told U.S. press not to publish
- Tried to prevent British from releasing
- Maintains Hamza is dead
- Won't reverse assessment

**Pattern:**
"Sometimes it's almost impossible to get the CIA to reverse an assessment."

**Benghazi Parallel:**
- CIA knew in real time Al-Qaeda was on compound
- Never changed assessment
- Stuck with "protest" narrative
- Refused to correct

**Current:**
- CIA maintains Hamza dead
- Won't investigate contrary evidence
- Won't reverse despite overwhelming proof
- Suppresses others from investigating

### Failure to Act on Intelligence

**Passed Intelligence Ignored:**

**Sarah Adams' Experience:**
- Passed mortar team information to FBI (November previous year)
- Still no response (year later)
- Passed ISIS threat information
- "Interesting and actionable"
- No response

**Embassy Threats:**
- Passed to appropriate officials
- Pentagon complained about method
- Never asked about content
- Never followed up
- Never investigated

**October 7th Intelligence:**
- Information passed to Israel about Hamas training
- Israel ignored it
- Adams received some of those reports
- Used in her investigation
- Proves Israel had warning

**U.S. Current:**
- Same information being passed about U.S. homeland attack
- Same pattern of ignoring
- "They're not taking it serious"
- Same mistake as Israel

### Organizational Failures

**FBI:**
- "Huge failure" in Benghazi investigation
- No response to mortar team info (1 year)
- No response to ISIS tip
- Watch list failures (discussed separately)
- Not adding known terrorists

**CIA:**
- Suppressing Hamza intelligence
- Won't reverse assessments
- Lost 99% collection capability
- Relies on Taliban for information
- No effort to rebuild networks

**Pentagon:**
- More concerned with protocols than threats
- No interest in collaborating with open source intel
- Bureaucracy over security

**State Department:**
- Sending $87 million/week to Taliban
- Funding terrorist training camps
- No accountability

**Congress:**
- No action on Taliban funding
- No action on terrorist designation
- "Five minute sound clips" but no follow-through
- Some actively opposing anti-Taliban measures

### Why Government Can't/Won't Collect

**Possible Reasons:**

1. **Incompetence:**
   - Lost capability
   - Can't rebuild networks
   - Don't know how anymore
   - Bureaucracy prevents action

2. **Willful Ignorance:**
   - Don't want to know
   - Would require action
   - Politically inconvenient
   - Easier to ignore

3. **Policy Constraints:**
   - Can't admit failure
   - Can't admit Taliban enemy
   - Maintains fiction of cooperation
   - Protects false narratives

4. **Institutional Inertia:**
   - Can't reverse assessments
   - Can't admit mistakes
   - Bureaucracy prevents change
   - Careers protected over truth

### Adams' Frustration

**Benghazi Context:**
"When we were in Benghazi we knew we had no counterterrorism collection. We relied on [local assets] and then we had no terrorist sources in terrorist groups in Benghazi at the time. We knew we were sitting ducks."

**Current Parallel:**
"I don't know how we can't get smart people to be honest and say yeah we don't have this collection. I don't have an asset - the US government not me - I don't have an asset on Hamza bin Laden. I need to go make an asset on Hamza bin Laden. I'm behind the curve. Why can't they do that? Why aren't they doing their jobs?"

**Hope for New Administration:**
"I hope some of these new Administration picks get in contact with you. You are super sharp."

**But Realistically:**
After Adams published October 7th report including Kazemi as mastermind of Soleimani plot:
- No contact from U.S. government
- No follow-up questions
- No investigation initiated
- Foreign government confirmed accuracy
- U.S. government: silence

### Public Perception vs. Reality

**What Public Told:**
- "Yeah this is all happening behind the scenes"
- "Don't worry everyone's prepared"
- "Our law enforcement knows"
- "Intelligence community has it handled"

**Reality:**
- Governor DeSantis: No threat reporting from federal government
- State law enforcement: No information
- First responders: No training
- "Most of the country have never heard Al-Qaeda's planning an attack here"

**Why It Matters:**
Without official threat reporting:
- Can't get budgets for training
- Can't justify new procedures
- Can't prepare properly
- No catalyst for action
- "We haven't even done this type of training in six years"

### Benghazi Watch List Failure

**Current Status:**
- Most Benghazi attackers not on FBI watch list
- Years after investigation
- Written to "over a dozen Congress people"
- No action taken
- Adams' team wants them added
- FBI ignoring

**Specific Case: Musa Ben Ali**

**Names:**
- Haqqanis call him: Musa Ben Ali
- Real name: Abdul Azim Ali Musa Ben Ali
- From: Al-Dar clan in Libya

**Activities:**
- 2012 Benghazi plotter
- Involved in U.S. homeland plot
- Helped Hamas attacks
- Helping embassy attacks against U.S.
- One of big logistics guys for Syria fighters
- "Al-Qaeda's Lord of War" (Adams' team report title)

**FBI Status:**
- Not on FBI Most Wanted List
- Not on any watch list
- "Only" a Benghazi attacker
- "Only" involved in multiple plots against U.S.
- "Completely ignored because he was involved in Benghazi attacks"

**Why It Matters:**
If FBI tracked him:
- Would have seen Syria fighter movements
- Would have known about training in Afghanistan
- Would have warning of multiple attacks
- "If you [had been] following him and targeting him you would have seen all these fighters move there"

**Pattern:**
- Government says "numbers are exaggerated" about Afghanistan training
- "We don't believe it"
- "If this was happening we'd see it"
- Reality: "You're not going to see it"
- Lost 99% of collection
- Rely on Taliban
- Taliban won't tell you

### Arrogance and Denial

**Adams' Assessment:**
"Getting over their arrogance... I don't know how we can't get smart people to be honest."

**Problem:**
Government won't admit:
- Lost intelligence capability
- Can't collect on threats
- Made massive mistakes
- Need to start over
- Need outside help

**Pride vs. Security:**
- Protecting careers over country
- Maintaining false narratives
- Can't admit failure
- Can't reverse assessments
- "Sometimes it's almost impossible to get the CIA to reverse an assessment"

**Result:**
- Enemies planning freely
- No U.S. intelligence on plans
- Open source investigators finding more than CIA
- Foreign governments know more than U.S.
- America unprepared for inevitable attack

## Additional Key Points and Themes

### Americans' Disconnect from Threat

**Adams' Observation:**
"There's a real disconnect in the US. The US is like 'Yeah well we haven't had terrorist attacks here.' Yeah because we were over there killing them. Now they plot, they train, we don't hit the camps."

**The Reality:**
"Americans don't understand that those attacks didn't happen here because you [Shawn Ryan] and I were overseas stopping them. They're like 'yeah it's fine' and they downplay it. It's like we've been saving you for 20 years, nobody's doing it anymore, so you better learn to save yourself."

**Why People Don't Believe:**
- No attacks in years (because U.S. was fighting them abroad)
- Terrorism seen as "political fear-mongering"
- Don't understand threat is real
- Disconnected from reality overseas
- No official government warnings
- Media not covering

**Adams' Frustration:**
"It's very frustrating. You can't get any support for this. They're like 'oh terrorism is just a political thing and they just try to bring fear in you' and it's like what are you talking about?"

### What's Different Now

**Then (During Afghanistan War):**
- U.S. forces in Afghanistan
- Bombing terrorist camps
- Killing terrorist leaders
- Disrupting training and planning
- Intelligence collection on ground
- Attacks delayed or prevented

**Now:**
- No U.S. presence
- No bombing of camps
- Terrorists train freely
- Multi-year planning uninterrupted
- 120,000 trained under Islamic Army
- State actor support (Iran, Russia, China)
- No intelligence collection

**Result:**
"We used to bomb the camps. You better learn to save yourself right. So it's a very frustrating thing."

### The October 7th Misunderstanding

**What People Think:**
- Hamas-only operation
- Palestinian resistance
- Regional conflict
- Nothing to do with U.S.

**Reality:**
- Al-Qaeda planned operation
- Taliban provided training and approval
- Iran (IRGC) co-planned
- Trained in Afghanistan
- Part of series targeting U.S. next
- Test run for U.S. homeland tactics

**Why It Matters:**
"That's just the first in the series that's coming for us. That's like the test run."

**Date Significance:**
October 7, 2001 - Operation Enduring Freedom began. "Nobody understands the October 7th attacks actually have a connection to Afghanistan to begin with."

### Money Irony

**Al-Qaeda's Joke:**
U.S. taxpayer dollars going to Taliban → Taliban giving to terrorist camps → Training terrorists for U.S. attack → "America is funding its own attack"

**Propaganda Value:**
- Will claim "inside job"
- U.S. government knew
- Funded it themselves
- Will target conspiracy theory community
- Make Americans distrust government more
- Similar to Building 7 conspiracy theories Al-Qaeda finds "fascinating"

**Adams:**
"That is the plan too - that the money will go back to us and our government and then that makes Americans also look at our government like it's an inside job, you knew it."

### Invisible Bomb Vest Impact

**Why It's Revolutionary:**
- Defeats metal detectors
- Defeats K-9 units
- Can enter any building
- Most U.S. security defeated
- No preparation for this technology

**Adams' Assessment:**
"I mean most of the buildings you go into even if they have some sort of thing it already defeats that. I mean I don't think we're prepared for anything that's coming. We're not."

### The Federal Government Isn't Preparing

**Governor DeSantis:**
"I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from the federal government."

**What States Aren't Getting:**
- Threat assessments
- Intelligence briefings
- Training recommendations
- Budget justifications
- Preparation guidance
- Any information at all

**Adams:**
"They're not passing anything down to these levels. Anyone who's like 'yeah this is all happening behind the scenes don't worry everyone's prepared our law enforcement knows' - most of the country have never heard Al-Qaeda's planning an attack here."

### Syria Context

**Trump's Statement:**
U.S. shouldn't even be in Syria, we're done there

**What Just Happened:**
- 10,000 Al-Qaeda trained fighters sent to Syria
- Supported Jolani's blitz
- Taliban provided training camps
- Recently completed operations
- Nobody reported Al-Qaeda/Taliban involvement
- Only reported as HTS operations

**What's Next:**
- Continued fighting (Kurds, others)
- Fighters may redeploy to Iraq or Africa (caliphate wave)
- Not expected to come to U.S. (different training/mission)
- Demonstrates scale of operations: 10,000 fighters for one operation

### Multiple Simultaneous Operations

**Al-Qaeda's Current Active Operations:**
1. Syria/Iraq (10,000 fighters - caliphate wave)
2. Africa expansion (Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso - caliphate wave)
3. Embassy attacks planning (multiple locations - anti-U.S. wave)
4. U.S. homeland attacks (1,000 fighters - anti-U.S. wave)
5. European attacks (1,000 fighters - anti-U.S. wave)
6. Soleimani revenge plot ($145M/month - Iran collaboration)

**Demonstrates:**
- Unprecedented capability
- Multiple simultaneous operations
- No resource constraints
- State-level organization
- Long-term planning
- Multi-year execution

### Adams' Personal Worry

"It makes me worried for my kids. That's what I really worry about. It's amazing we only empowered these terrorists for a few years but look what they've done with it."

### The Libya Comparison

**Adams worked Libyan Revolution:**
- Every group wanted Gaddafi dead
- United despite including terrorists
- Immediate goal brought everyone together
- External council formed (led by Jalel)
- No single military commander
- Multiple groups, multiple areas, coordinated

**Afghanistan Lacks:**
- No equivalent unifying goal
- No catalyst to bring groups together
- Regional interests over national
- Undercut each other
- Taliban sympathizers at table
- Need for unity but don't have it

### What Normal People Are Doing

**Shawn Ryan's Observation:**
"A lot of people are getting ready. A lot of people are yanking their kids out of school because of safety. A lot of people are at least yanking them out of schools that have no safety precautions or any plan at all."

**Why:**
- Government won't inform
- Government won't prepare
- People informed through alternative media
- Taking personal responsibility
- Protecting families themselves

**Scott Mann's Message:**
"Nobody's coming to save you. This machine is no longer working. You better take matters into your own hands."

### The Certainty

**Shawn Ryan:**
"I want to be kind of clear here. When? How certain are you we'll see something in 2025?"

**Sarah Adams:**
"I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the Homeland attack or both."

---

## Closing Statements

**Shawn Ryan's Assessment:**
"We got a love-hate relationship. I love having you on, I hate the information that you bring us. But you know we need to know it because the government doesn't want to take this shit seriously. A lot of citizens do and you know they're getting ready."

**Importance of Information:**
"It's important that regular everyday Americans hear this stuff because like you said, like Scott Mann says, nobody's coming to save you. This machine is no longer working. You better take matters into your own hands."

**Weekly Intelligence:**
"Once again Sarah you write our intelligence newsletter every week, comes out every Monday. Benghazi Know Thy Enemy, we'll link it in the description below."

**Follow-up:**
Fourth episode with Sarah Adams already scheduled for 2025.

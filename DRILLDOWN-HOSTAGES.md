## Executive Summary

This report documents American citizens held hostage by the Taliban, the systematic hunting and killing of Afghan allies using U.S. biometric systems, and the profound irony that the organization holding Americans captive receives direct weekly cash payments from the U.S. government. Three Americans—Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann, and Mahmood Habibi—are confirmed held by GDI (General Directorate of Intelligence), which is one of the eight recipients of U.S. weekly cash deliveries totaling $44-87 million. Additionally, over 10,000 Afghan allies have been killed and 30,000+ captured using HIDE, SEEK, and BAT biometric systems left behind at Bagram Air Base.

**Key Findings:**
- Three American hostages held by organization receiving U.S. funding
- GDI (holding Americans) receives direct weekly U.S. cash payments
- 10,000+ Afghan allies killed using U.S. biometric systems
- 30,000+ Afghan allies captured using same systems
- HIDE, SEEK, BAT systems left at Bagram now hunt U.S. allies
- Taliban manhunt continues daily using U.S. technology
- No successful rescue operations
- U.S. continues funding captors while Americans held

- Condition and treatment unknown
- Duration of captivity: Multiple years

### Common Factors

**All Three Americans:**
1. **Held by GDI** - Taliban's General Directorate of Intelligence
2. **Captured post-withdrawal** - After August 2021 U.S. evacuation
3. **No rescue operations** - U.S. has not attempted armed rescue
4. **Negotiations failing** - Little to no progress on release
5. **Families advocating** - Public campaigns for attention
6. **Government awareness** - U.S. knows they're held, location of captivity
7. **Funding continues** - U.S. sends money to their captors weekly

---

## GDI (General Directorate of Intelligence)

### Organizational Profile

**Official Name:** General Directorate of Intelligence
**Function:** Taliban intelligence service
**Leadership:** Taliban appointed directors
**Size:** Estimated thousands of personnel
**Locations:** Headquarters in Kabul, regional offices throughout Afghanistan

### Role in Taliban Government

**Primary Functions:**
1. **Internal Security** - Monitor Afghan population
2. **Counterintelligence** - Identify foreign intelligence operations
3. **Interrogation** - Extract information from prisoners
4. **Surveillance** - Track resistance and opposition
5. **Manhunt Operations** - Using U.S. biometric systems to hunt allies

### U.S. Relationship

**The Contradiction:**

GDI is simultaneously:
1. **Holding three American hostages**
2. **Receiving U.S. cash payments weekly**
3. **Using U.S. biometric systems to kill U.S. allies**
4. **Coordinating with Al-Qaeda**
5. **Training terrorists for attacks on U.S.**

**Sarah Adams' Observation:**
GDI appears on the list of eight weekly cash delivery destinations, meaning U.S. taxpayer money flows directly to the organization holding Americans captive.

### Historical Background

**Pre-2021:**
- Afghan intelligence service worked with CIA
- Partnered with U.S. special operations
- Trained by U.S. personnel
- Shared intelligence against Taliban

**Post-2021:**
- Gutted of pro-U.S. personnel
- Staffed by Taliban loyalists
- Now operates against U.S. interests
- Holds Americans hostage
- Hunts former Afghan allies

### Connection to Haqqani Network

**Sirajuddin Haqqani:**
- Taliban Interior Minister
- Haqqani Network leader
- Controls security apparatus including GDI
- Receives largest share of U.S. payments ($15-18M monthly)
- Designated terrorist

**GDI Under Haqqani:**
- Reports to Interior Ministry
- Implements Haqqani policies
- Used for Haqqani Network operations
- Coordinates with Al-Qaeda on Haqqani's behalf

---

## The Funding Irony

### The Eight Weekly Delivery Stops

**U.S. Weekly Cash Delivery:** $44-87 million

**Eight Recipients:**
1. Prime Minister office
2. Deputy Prime Minister
3. Supreme Leader (Hibatullah Akhundzada)
4. **GDI (holding three Americans)**
5. Sirajuddin Haqqani (Ministry + personal residence)
6. Al-Qaeda Military Commission (Saif al-Adel)
7. The Bin Laden brothers (Hamza, Saad, Abdullah)
8. (Eighth recipient not specified in detail)

### Direct Payment to Captors

**The Facts:**
- GDI holds Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann, Mahmood Habibi
- U.S. government aware they're held by GDI
- U.S. continues weekly cash payments to GDI
- No conditions on payments (no "release Americans or we stop paying")

**Amount to GDI:**
While specific breakdowns aren't provided, GDI receives portion of $44-87 million weekly, meaning:
- Minimum: Millions per month to organization holding Americans
- Maximum: Tens of millions per month

**Timeline:**
- Americans captured: Post-August 2021
- Payments began: August 2021
- Payments continue: Through December 2024
- Duration: 40+ months of funding their captors
- Total to GDI (estimated): $100-500 million while holding Americans

### Congressional Knowledge

**Petition Results:**
- 382,000+ signatures to stop Taliban funding
- Submitted to Congress
- **Result: Zero action**

**Legislative Efforts:**
1. **Congressman Burchett's Bill** - Stop Taliban funding
   - Passed House
   - Sitting in Senate with no sponsor
   - No senator will shepherd it through

2. **Congresswoman Nancy Mace's Bill** - Designate Taliban as terrorists
   - Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose
   - Bill killed
   - Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists

**Congressional Reaction to Hostages:**
- Aware Americans held
- Aware GDI holding them
- Aware U.S. funding GDI
- Continue appropriating funds for payments
- No conditions placed on aid
- No penalties for holding Americans

### The Logic (or Lack Thereof)

**Stated Justification:**
- Need humanitarian access
- Must work with de facto government
- Payments ensure cooperation

**Reality:**
- Payments have no conditions
- Taliban does whatever it wants
- Americans still held
- Afghan allies still hunted and killed
- Al-Qaeda still trained
- No accountability

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
This represents pay-to-play at the highest level, with U.S. government funding designated terrorists who:
- Hold American hostages
- Kill American allies
- Train attackers for American homeland
- Coordinate with Al-Qaeda
- Support terrorist operations globally

## Afghan Allies - The Massacre

### The Numbers

**Confirmed Killed:** 10,000+ former Afghan allies
**Confirmed Captured:** 30,000+
**Total Affected:** 40,000+ minimum

**Who They Were:**
1. **Afghan National Army soldiers**
2. **Afghan National Police**
3. **Intelligence service (NDS) personnel**
4. **Special Forces (trained with U.S.)**

### How Taliban Identifies Them

**Primary Method: U.S. Biometric Systems**

Three main systems left at Bagram:
1. **HIDE (Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment)**
2. **SEEK (Secure Electronic Enrollment Kit)**
3. **BAT (Biometric Automated Toolset)**

**What Systems Contain:**
- Fingerprints of everyone who worked with U.S.
- Iris scans
- Facial recognition photos
- Full biographic data
- Employment records
- Unit affiliations
- Family connections
- Contact information
- Home addresses

**Taliban Process:**

**Step 1: Checkpoint Setup**
- Taliban sets up checkpoint
- Biometric device deployed
- Every Afghan passing through scanned

**Step 2: Identification**
- Fingerprints collected
- System searches database
- Match to U.S. ally
- Employment history revealed

**Step 3: Detention**
- Individual immediately detained
- Family members identified
- Associates tracked
- Network mapped

**Step 4: Interrogation/Execution**
- Torture for intelligence
- Force to reveal others
- Public execution or disappearance
- Family threatened or killed

### Secondary Identification Methods

**Cell Phone Data:**
- Contact lists reviewed
- Call records examined
- Text messages read
- WhatsApp conversations accessed
- Social media accounts checked

**Neighborhood Informants:**
- Taliban pays for information
- Neighbors report former government workers
- Financial incentive to betray
- Fear of being reported encourages reporting others

**Financial Records:**

- Salary records from government
- Payment history from U.S. contractors
- Property ownership records

**Physical Evidence:**

### The Amnesty Lie

**Taliban's Promise (August 2021):**
> "General amnesty for all who worked with previous government and foreign forces"

**Reality:**
- Amnesty never existed
- Systematic hunting began immediately
- Lists prepared in advance
- Coordinated operations across country
- No protection for anyone who cooperated with U.S.

**Trap Mechanism:**
Some Afghans:
1. Believed amnesty promise
2. Registered with Taliban as required
3. Provided fingerprints "for record keeping"
4. Later rounded up using those very fingerprints
5. Executed for "crimes against Islamic Emirate"

## The Bagram Abandonment

### July 1, 2021 - The Night They Left

**Timeline:**

**Bagram Air Base:**
- Largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan
- Housed critical intelligence
- Detention facility with thousands of prisoners
- Biometric data center
- Equipment worth billions

**What Happened:**
> "US snuck out of Bagram Air Base in middle of night. Did not tell commander of Bagram of departure. Commander arrived in morning. Taliban and terrorists breaking prisoners out."

**Exact Sequence:**

**11:00 PM (approx) - July 1, 2021:**
- U.S. forces begin withdrawal
- Done in secret
- No coordination with Afghan commander
- Lights turned off
- Power cut

**Early Morning - July 2, 2021:**
- Afghan base commander arrives for work
- Finds base abandoned
- U.S. gone completely
- Perimeter breached
- Prisoners escaping

**Within Hours:**
- Taliban and terrorists flooding in
- Mass prisoner breakout
- Equipment looting begins
- Biometric systems seized
- Abbey Gate bomber released

### What Was Left Behind

**Prisoners:**
- 5,000+ high-value detainees
- Includes Abbey Gate bomber
- Al-Qaeda members
- Taliban commanders
- ISIS-K fighters
- Foreign fighters

**Biometric Systems:**
- HIDE devices (portable)
- SEEK II systems
- BAT central database
- All containing Afghan ally information

**Equipment:**
- Armored vehicles
- Weapons and ammunition
- Night vision devices
- Communication gear
- Intelligence documents

**Intelligence:**
- Files on Afghan allies
- Operation records
- Network diagrams
- Asset information
- Methods and sources

### Abbey Gate Bomber Release

**Abdul Rahim Sangari:**
- True name of Abbey Gate bomber
- Held at Bagram since 2017
- ISIS member, sent to India to conduct attacks
- Captured in New Delhi, sent to Bagram
- **Released July 1, 2021**

**Timeline After Release:**
- **July 1**: Released from Bagram
- **August 18**: In Kandahar at operational planning meeting
- **August 26**: Conducts suicide bombing at Abbey Gate
- **Result**: 13 U.S. service members killed, 170+ Afghans killed

**Time from Release to Attack:** 56 days

### CENTCOM Investigation Failure

**3.5 Year Investigation:**
- 12-person panel
- Released April 2024
- Key finding: "Abdul Rahman al-Logari - that's a Kunya or an alias"
- **After 3.5 years, they never identified his true name**

**Sarah Adams' Investigation:**
- Started: April 2024 (when CENTCOM report released)
- Released: August 2024
- Duration: 4 months
- **Result: Found bomber's true name - Abdul Rahim Sangari**

**Adams' Assessment:**
> "If you actually know how to investigate and you look into it you can find all these holes. They did not do their job properly. They couldn't even find the true name of a man who blew up 13 of our service members. That's how little they cared."

### Why Bagram Was Abandoned

**Official Explanation:**
- Part of withdrawal plan
- Drawdown of forces
- Consolidation to Kabul

**Operational Reality:**
- No warning to Afghan partners
- No time to evacuate Afghan allies
- No attempt to destroy intelligence
- No attempt to secure or destroy biometric systems
- No plan for prisoner transfer

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**

### Bagram Today (2024)

**Current Use:**
- Chinese PMC (Private Military Company) presence
- Chinese personnel on base
- Taliban control
- Al-Qaeda access
- Training facility
- Detention facility (now for U.S. allies)

### Videos Sent to U.S. Military

**Taliban Tactic:**
> "Videos of 'very very painful deaths.' Really bad torture deaths. Some really bad beheading deaths of our allies. All the guys we used to work with over there. Videos sent during or after deaths as taunts."

**Kabul Airport Examples:**
- U.S. military present but couldn't respond

## Failed Rescue Attempts

### U.S. Government Efforts: Minimal to None

**Official Position:**
- Aware of three American hostages
- "Negotiating" with Taliban
- Via third parties (Qatar most likely)
- No progress in years

**What U.S. Has NOT Done:**
- Armed rescue operation
- Commando raid to extract
- Serious pressure on Taliban
- Conditions on aid payments
- Sanctions against specific individuals holding them
- Special operations task force deployment

**Why No Rescue:**

**Official Reasoning:**
- Don't want to endanger hostages
- Prefer negotiated solution
- Don't know exact location (questionable)
- Risk of failure
- Political complications

**Reality:**
- Administration wants to forget Afghanistan
- Rescue would draw attention back
- Would require acknowledging failure
- Would interfere with cash payments
- Politically inconvenient

### Volunteer Efforts

**Who's Trying:**
- Former military who served with Afghans
- Former intelligence officers
- NGO workers
- Private citizens
- Afghan-American community

**What They Do:**
- Advocate for hostages
- Raise public awareness
- Pressure government
- Attempt communications with Taliban
- Explore private rescue options
- Fundraise for potential ransom

**Obstacles:**
- U.S. government not helping
- Actually obstructing some efforts
- No intelligence shared
- No coordination
- Some volunteers investigated for "unauthorized negotiations"

### Task Force Pineapple

**Organization:**
- Scott Mann's organization
- One of "louder ones" talking about Afghanistan issues
- Government wanted to "diffuse that"

**Afghan Evac Involvement:**
- Part of efforts to evacuate Afghans
- Vocal about government failures
- Public about what's really happening

**Government Response:**
- Created Afghan Evac coalition to control narrative
- Tried to quiet Task Force Pineapple
- Wanted them to stop publicly criticizing

### Moral Compass Federation

**Description:**
- "The rogue entity to the side"
- Sarah Adams is member
- Tyler Vargas Andrews (Abbey Gate Marine) is member
- NOT part of Afghan Evac coalition

**Why Separate:**
- "If I'm in something it's like the rogue entity to the side"
- "We don't want to play with this game"
- Won't sign NDAs to hide truth
- Continue speaking openly

**Focus:**
- Finding and exposing truth
- Not cooperating with cover-up
- Protecting what can be done

### Individual Volunteers

**Thousands Involved:**
- "Since there's like a thousand of us helping Afghans"
- Spread across many organizations
- Various levels of involvement
- Some with access, some without

**Government Harassment:**
- "There was some - in some government agencies they had people did go after, they were gone after for actually helping with the Evac"
- Some investigated
- Some lost jobs
- Some under scrutiny

**Sarah Adams' Experience:**
- "My job - very different. My bosses were super supportive of me being involved in the Afghan evacuation"
- "A large number of people in my office actually supported it"
- Not all volunteers face problems, depends on employer

**The Real Divide:**
- "I think the majority of actually worker bees in the US government were supportive of helping Afghans"
- "It's kind of the senior level stuff that we all stay out of"
- "I think normal everyday people who have worked counterterrorism their whole career are very concerned about Afghanistan"

## Congressional Inaction

### The 382,000 Signature Petition

**Campaign:**
- Petition to stop funding Taliban
- 382,000+ signatures collected

**Result:**
> **Zero action taken**

**No hearings** on why U.S. funds organization holding Americans
**No investigations** into hostage situations
**No conditions** placed on Taliban funding
**No pressure** on Taliban to release Americans

### Legislative Failures

#### Congressman Burchett's Bill

**Purpose:** Stop Taliban funding

**Status:**
- Introduced in House
- Passed House
- Sitting in Senate with no sponsor
- No senator will shepherd through process

**Obstacle:**
- Need senator to champion
- No one willing despite American hostages
- Political calculation: Afghanistan issue is "over"
- Better to ignore than address

#### Congresswoman Nancy Mace's Bill

**Purpose:** Designate Taliban as terrorist organization

**What Happened:**
- Bill introduced
- Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose
- Told her to withdraw or kill bill
- Bill died

**Result:**
> "Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists" despite them holding Americans hostage

**Implications:**
- If not terrorist, can keep paying
- Provides legal cover for payments
- Avoids material support charges
- Politics over hostages

### Congressional Knowledge of Hostage Situation

**They Know:**
1. Three Americans held
2. Held by GDI specifically
3. GDI receives U.S. payments
4. Payments continue while Americans held
5. No progress on negotiations
6. Taliban violating every norm

**They Continue:**
1. Appropriating funds
2. Sending cash weekly
3. No conditions on payments
4. No penalties for holding Americans
5. No rescue authorization
6. No special operations deployment

### Congressman McCaul (House Foreign Affairs Chairman)

**Position:**
- Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee
- Should be leading on hostage issue
- Responsible for oversight of State Department

**Recent Incident:**
- Public intoxication at airport
- Known issue: Insider trading allegations

**Action on Taliban Funding:**
- None

**Pattern:**
- Brings witnesses for "five-minute sound clips"
- No follow-through
- No accountability measures
- No action following testimony
- Tyler Andrew Vargas (Abbey Gate Marine) testified - no action

### Why Congress Won't Act

**Sarah Adams' Theory:**
> "Some members of Congress may believe the Haqqani Network (particularly Sirajuddin Haqqani) can be used as a conduit against Russia, particularly regarding the Ukraine war. This is the only logical explanation for the unprecedented funding levels."

**The Calculation:**
1. Afghanistan is "over" politically
2. Public has moved on (they think)
3. Media not covering extensively
4. Three hostages vs. larger geopolitical games
5. Funding Taliban to somehow counter Russia
6. Career more important than three lives

**Adams' Assessment:**
> "They really think this is just going to go away. The only reason Afghanistan hasn't gone away is all these pesky volunteers like me, like Scott [Mann], whomever, still trying to save their Afghans. We've gotten in their way and they're sick of it. They're just waiting to plow through us until it's not in the press anymore and it's ignored and they can move on."

---

## Volunteer Efforts

### The Movement

**Scale:**
> "Since there's like a thousand of us helping Afghans"

**Who:**
- Veterans who served in Afghanistan
- Intelligence officers who worked there
- Contractors who employed Afghans
- NGO workers
- Private citizens moved by crisis
- Afghan-American community

**What They Do:**
1. Evacuate Afghans still in danger
2. Support those who escaped
3. Document Taliban atrocities
4. Advocate for policy changes
5. Pressure government
6. Share intelligence
7. Raise awareness

### Major Organizations

**Task Force Pineapple (Scott Mann):**
- One of most visible groups
- Successfully evacuated thousands
- Vocal about government failures
- Target of government efforts to silence

**Moral Compass Federation (Sarah Adams, Tyler Vargas Andrews):**
- "Rogue entity to the side"
- Won't cooperate with cover-up
- Continues speaking truth
- Independent from government control

**Afghan Evac (Government-Created Coalition):**
- Partnership between government and NGOs
- Created to control narrative
- "Keeps people quiet"
- Requires "tons of NDAs"
- Sarah Adams left after third NDA
- "To keep the volunteer groups in line"
- "To make them mentally happy"
- "Cover to drag out the evac 100%"
- Two years later (2023): "Still doing monthly meetings"
- "People still talk about it like it's really saving people"

### Individual Actions

**Intelligence Sharing:**
- Volunteers on ground in Pakistan, elsewhere
- Share information on Taliban movements
- Identify Afghans in danger
- Coordinate rescues
- Provide to U.S. government (usually ignored)

**Evacuation Coordination:**
- Safe house networks
- Border crossing assistance
- Document procurement (legal)
- Travel coordination
- Destination support

**Financial Support:**
- Fundraising for evacuations
- Supporting refugees in third countries
- Helping resettled Afghans
- Funding continued operations

### Government Response to Volunteers

**Obstruction:**
- Some volunteers investigated
- Some lost security clearances
- Some fired from government jobs
- Some threatened with prosecution
- "Unauthorized negotiations" charges threatened

**Co-option:**
- Afghan Evac coalition created
- Tries to control volunteer narrative
- Requires NDAs to participate
- Limits what can be said publicly
- "Defuses" critical voices

**Tolerance:**
- Some government employees support volunteers
- Individual supervisors allow participation
- "Worker bees" generally supportive
- "Senior level" generally opposed

**Sarah Adams' Experience:**
- Her bosses supported her Afghan work
- Many in her office supported it
- Depends on specific agency and supervisors
- "Majority of actually worker bees in the US government were supportive"

### Why Government Wants Them Gone

**The Problem Volunteers Pose:**
> "They never expected 20 years of veterans or Intel officers that worked in the country or even just NGOs who had supported the country were going to go back in and save their allies. We got in their way, like in a bad way."

**Narrative Disruption:**
- Government: "We left 100 Americans behind"
- Volunteers compiled data: "8,000 Americans are left behind"
- Exposed lies about numbers
- Showed scale of abandonment
- Kept Afghanistan in news

**Continued Attention:**
> "The only reason Afghanistan hasn't gone away is all these pesky volunteers like me, like Scott, whomever, still trying to save their Afghans. We've gotten in their way and they're sick of it."

**What Government Wants:**
- Afghanistan forgotten
- Public moved on
- No scrutiny of decisions
- No accountability
- Cash keeps flowing to Taliban
- "Plow through us until it's not in the press anymore"

## The Afghan Evac Deception

### Creation and Purpose

**When:** Post-August 2021 withdrawal

**Why:**
> "The government's not dumb. Made coalition to get people to be quiet."

**Target:**
- Task Force Pineapple (Scott Mann)
- Other vocal volunteer groups
- "One of the louder ones obviously talking about the issues"
- Government wanted to "diffuse that"

### Structure

**Coalition:**
- Partnership between government and NGOs
- Multiple organizations brought in
- Regular meetings
- Coordination structure
- Information sharing (controlled)

**Who's Not In It:**
- Moral Compass Federation
- "Of course not all of us are a part of it"
- "The rogue entity to the side"
- "If I'm in something it's like the rogue entity to the side"

### Control Mechanisms

**NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements):**
> "Must sign tons of NDAs. After the third NDA I was like what the f***, I'm out of this group."

**Purpose of NDAs:**
- Limit what members can say publicly
- Prevent criticism of government
- Control information flow
- Legal liability for speaking out
- Create obligation to government

**Function:**
> "Just talks what State Department wants to talk. Keeps people quiet."

### Two Years Later (2023)

**Still Operating:**
> "Two years later: They still do their monthly meetings. People still talk about it like it's really saving people."

**Adams' Assessment:**
> "It is a cover to drag out the evac 100%. All these groups just fall in line with it."

**Initial Hope:**
- Adams initially thought: "I hope they know that they're being played"
- Two years later: Still participating
- Haven't figured it out or don't care

### Actual Results

**Evacuations:**
- Some Afghans still being evacuated
- Numbers far lower than volunteers alone achieved
- Bureaucratic process slow
- Many abandoned

**Real Purpose:**
> "To keep the volunteer groups in line. To make them mentally happy."

**Effect:**
- Volunteers feel they're participating in solution
- Actually neutered from effective advocacy
- Can't speak publicly due to NDAs
- Energy diverted to meetings instead of action
- Government controls narrative

### Why Volunteers Stay

**Reasons:**
1. Believe they're helping
2. Access to some information
3. Coordination with others
4. Hopeful government will do right thing
5. Don't realize it's a control mechanism
6. Feel obligation to try anything

**Sarah Adams Left Because:**
- Too many NDAs
- Saw through the deception
- Rather be free to speak truth
- "We don't want to play with this game"
- More effective outside the structure

## Conclusion

Three American citizens remain hostage in Taliban custody, held by an organization that receives regular cash payments from the U.S. government. Over 10,000 Afghan allies have been systematically hunted down and killed using biometric systems that the United States left behind at Bagram Air Base. Another 30,000+ are in captivity, facing torture and execution.

The greatest irony is that the American taxpayer funds both the captors and the hunters. While Congress collected 382,000 signatures demanding an end to Taliban funding, not a single legislative effort has succeeded. The organization holding Americans hostage (GDI) is literally on the weekly cash delivery list.

Thousands of volunteers—veterans, intelligence officers, and private citizens—continue working to save Afghan allies and raise awareness about American hostages, despite government obstruction and attempts to silence them. They represent the best of America's commitment to its allies, while official policy represents a betrayal that will echo for generations.

**The Numbers:**
- 3 American hostages held by U.S.-funded organization
- 10,000+ Afghan allies killed using U.S. biometric systems
- 30,000+ Afghan allies in Taliban captivity
- $44-87 million sent weekly to organization holding Americans
- $2.3-4.5 billion annually to Taliban/Al-Qaeda from U.S.
- 382,000 petition signatures ignored
- 0 Congressional actions successful
- 0 Americans rescued
- 1,000+ volunteers still fighting

This is not ancient history. This is happening now. Today. While you read this, the hunting continues. The funding continues. The captivity continues. And America does nothing.

## 9/11 and Initial Response (2001)

### September 11, 2001

**The Attacks**
- Al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. homeland
- Planned from Afghanistan
- **Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM)** mastermind
- 3,000+ killed
- **Date significance:** Most Americans don't know why this date chosen:
  - September 11, 1922: British Mandate began
  - First time Westerner put in charge of Palestinian mandate
  - Not about "school starting" or "9-1-1" or "Allah"

**Why This Date Matters:**
Terrorists choose dates based on historical significance to them, not to us. This pattern continues with October 7th selection.

### October 7, 2001

**Operation Enduring Freedom Announced**
- George Bush announces operation
- **U.S. begins carpet bombing Kandahar**
- **THIS DATE becomes anniversary terrorists commemorate**
- **Direct reason October 7, 2023 chosen for Hamas attacks**
- Most Americans and government don't recognize this Afghanistan connection

### October-December 2001

**U.S. Invasion**
- U.S. enters Afghanistan
- **Taliban defeated in approximately 5 weeks**
- "Amazing, amazing, like raw raw USA. They really kicked ass, they toppled the Taliban"
- Taliban go home, view conflict as finished
- **Mullah Baradar takes Mullah Omar to hide in Waziristan**
- Mullah Omar likely never leaves that location

**Bin Laden Escapes**
- Crosses from Tora Bora into Pakistan
- "War on Al-Qaeda was kind of over"

**Al-Qaeda Senior Leaders Flee Afghanistan**
- Two destinations: **Pakistan and Iran**
- Most do not stay to fight
- **Iran path proves safer:**
  - Terrorists and families relocate to Iran
  - Live there with wives and children
  - Develop close relationship with Iranian government
  - **Qasem Soleimani personally oversees protection**
  - **Mohammad Kazemi tasked to keep leaders safe**
  - Specifically protected: Hamza bin Laden, Saif al-Adel, Benghazi plotters

---

## War on Terror Operations (2002-2008)

### 2002-2003: Taliban Resurgence Triggered

**U.S. Decision to Target Old Taliban Leaders**

- Father injured in bombing
- **Baradar's response:** "Screw this, I'm going on offense"
- "You beat us and then you come back here months later and you bomb my house"
- **"That's when he triggered over and said okay, game's on, Taliban's back"**
- Taliban insurgency restarts from this single provocation

**CIA Debriefing Program (2002-2003)**
- Mapped Dawood Badini's house (KSM's brother-in-law)
- This decade-old intelligence later enables 2011 capture of Younis Al-Mauritani
- "Greatest collection of counterterrorism information ever"

### 2003-2004 Onward: Iraq Wars

**Multiple Future Benghazi Attackers Fight in Iraq**

### 2008

**November 2008: Mumbai Attacks**
- **Lashkar-e-Taiba** (Pakistani terrorist group) conducts attack
- Multiple locations in Mumbai targeted
- Killed very large number of people
- **Attack methodology becomes template for future operations:**
  - Swarming multiple locations
  - Real-time intelligence to attackers

  - Extended duration (multiple days)
  - Fedayeen fighters (fight to death)
- **This model used for:**

  - Attack originally planned for Peshawar, Pakistan
  - Asset changed location to Khost at last minute
  - Ruse: Doctor treating Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri
  - Zawahiri was "number two most important terrorist in CIA"
  - Jordanian agent actually working for Al-Qaeda/TTP
  - **Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri directly involved in planning**
- Sarah Adams in different Pakistani city, learned of attack upon return

- **Relationship established that continues to present**

### January 2010: Capture of Mullah Baradar

**The Operation - January 2010**

**Setup:**
- Phone activated while Adams flying to Islamabad
- Contact called: "Baradar's phone is up" (active entire flight)
- Highly unusual - "doesn't make any sense"
- Leadership vacuum: COSOS conference ongoing, top leaders gone

**Authorization Issues:**
- Adams approached Chief of Liaison
- Chief: "Let me think about it"
- **Adams didn't wait for answer**
- Went directly to team operators
- "We got two in Lahore, we'll move them"

**The Quetta Problem:**
- Chief of Base Quetta obsessed with different target: **Tahir Shaw**
- Shaw was deputy shadow governor for Helmand
- "Eleanor" (Gone in 60 Seconds reference - target never captured)
- Chief: "I don't think it's Baradar. I'm going to go for Tahir Shaw"
- Wasted first half of day pursuing Shaw (failed again)

**The Break:**
- Phone moving from Quetta to Karachi
- Adams' insight: "This is his kid"
- "No way Baradar rode to another city with his phone and rode back"
- Decision: Wait until phone returns home
- Phone returned to exact neighborhood Adams predicted

**Capture Success:**
- **"We just got really lucky his kid stole his old phone out of the closet and brought on a trip with his dad"**
- Authorization status: Top 10 Taliban pre-approved
- But all approving officers were gone
- "We really got no approvals because nobody was in country"

**Identification Complications:**
- Photo sent to unreliable CIA asset in Afghanistan
- Asset failed to ID
- Everyone concluded: "It's not him"
- Adams: "No it's him. That source is crap and you need to finally fire him"
- Positive ID from reliable sources confirmed

**The Revelation - Interrogation Questions:**
- Adams wanted him for operations intelligence
- Questions from headquarters all about reconciliation:
  - "Who would you be okay with coming to meet with you about peace?"
  - "Would you be okay if Japan came, the Brits came?"
- **Adams' realization: "Oh my gosh, they only want this guy for reconciliation"**
- "That's when I saw we're going to make a deal with the Taliban"

**Immediate White House Takeover:**
- Chief brought Adams and debriefers to office
- "This is the number one focus in the White House"
- Sent psychiatrist to watch debriefings
- Purpose: "Make sure we had rapport with him"
- "They were already kissing his butt right after we caught him"

**Character Assessment:**
- "This guy was smart, he was charismatic. He was probably a genius"
- Could remember conversations from days prior
- Provided logical justifications for Taliban actions
- Very persuasive with U.S. policymakers

**Adams' Regret:**
- "If I went back in time I never would have captured him"
- "He is the reason the whole country fell"

## Libya Revolution and Al-Qaeda Resurgence (2011)

### Early 2011: Libyan Revolution Begins

**The Reality vs. Public Perception**
- Public perception: Democratic movement
- **Reality:** "The Libyan Revolution was not some democratic movement"
- **"It was terrorist taking it to Gaddafi because he locked them up forever"**
- **"Most of the people fighting it or at least leading militias were terrorists"**
- **Al-Qaeda brought in lots of terrorists to fight**

**U.S. Role:**
- Air support only
- Dropped bombs from planes
- "That's how we helped them win"
- NOT like Soviet-Afghan War (no Charlie Wilson's War model)
- No ground weapons distribution like Stingers

**Common Misconception:**
- People think MANPADs in Libya are U.S.-provided Stingers
- Reality: **Russian SA-7s, SA-9s from Gaddafi stockpiles**
- Proliferated everywhere after Gaddafi fell
- U.S. trying to recover them so terrorists don't get them

### June 2011: Drone Strikes on Al-Zawahiri's Deputies

**Pakistan Drone Strikes**
- Two of Zawahiri's last deputies killed in U.S. strikes
- **Abu Yahya al-Libi** (most recent deputy) killed
- Both died within one year in Pakistan
- Second strike: June 2011
- **Zawahiri's response:** "Enough's enough, we're going to take it to the Americans in Libya"
- This becomes direct motivation for Benghazi attacks

### End of October 2011: Gaddafi Falls

**Revolution Success**
- Gaddafi killed
- No intelligence service when Arab Spring kicked off
- Terrorist groups immediately position themselves
- Government formation begins

**Government Structure:**
- Two competing governments form
- **East:** General Haftar, Libyan National Army (LNA)
- **West:** Government U.S. aligns with
- **"Government in Libya stayed with the terrorists because the terrorists kept them in power"**
- Old LIFG, Al-Qaeda remain aligned with western government
- **"The US Ally in Libya is the same side al-Qaeda is on"** (continues for 10+ years)

### November 2011: Al-Qaeda Enters Benghazi

**Al-Qaeda Establishes Base**
- **Beginning of November 2011:** Al-Qaeda starts setting up real base in Benghazi
- Just weeks after Gaddafi's death
- Building toward September 2012 attacks
- Recruiting, organizing, planning operations

**Libya Timeline Comparison:**
- End October 2011: Gaddafi fell
- Beginning November 2011: Al-Qaeda setting up in Benghazi
- September 2012: Benghazi attacks (less than one year)
- 2014-2017: War against them (they're powerful enough to require 3-year war)
- **This timeline becomes template for understanding Afghanistan regeneration**

### 2011: Post-UBL Raid - Younis Al-Mauritani Capture

**Context:**
- Bin Laden raid conducted
- Pakistan stops issuing visas
- CIA sends many Americans home
- Fear: Pakistanis might arrest Americans involved

**Visa Solution:**
- Looked for personnel with valid visas
- **Maya** (Bin Laden analyst) had 10-year visa, volunteered to return
- CIA leadership concerned (all of ISI knew her)
- Sarah Adams had 5-year visa
- Adams and one other woman deployed instead

**Younis Al-Mauritani Profile:**
- Al-Qaeda external operations commander
- Equivalent role to KSM
- "10 guys died since" KSM
- "Kind of like the C team" but in charge of external plotting

**The Intelligence:**
- Information: Al-Mauritani leaving Pakistan for Africa
- Plan: Plot attacks in Europe from Africa
- Adams assumes Libya (given the year)

**CIA-ISI Relations Crisis:**
- Pakistan station "like a ghost town"
- "Doing nothing, there's no work going on"
- No CIA-ISI operations ongoing

**The Tennis-Playing Chief:**
- Adams: "Can you call ISI about capturing Younis?"
- Chief of Liaison: "I don't talk to ISI"
- Adams: "But you're the Chief of Liaison, your only job is liaison with ISI"
- Chief: "Yeah. I don't have their phone number."
- **"I'm only here to play tennis"**
- Chief literally grabbed tennis racket and left meeting

**Adams Finds ISI Contact:**
- Old notebook by phone had ISI numbers
- Called ISI directly
- ISI officer knew Adams
- "Come on over"

**The Deal:**
- Met with very senior ISI officer (likely head of CT directorate)
- ISI: "We'd be interested but we're really upset about Bin Laden"
- ISI condition: "If you handshake with me that you'll tell us if you're going to go get Ayman al-Zawahiri in Pakistan, we'll do it"
- Adams thought: "We were nowhere near getting Zawahiri"
- **Adams shook his hand (had no authority to do so)**
- ISI: "Okay" - began planning operation
- **"One meeting with ISI to restart capture operations. That was it."**

**Al-Qaeda Karachi Leader Bonus:**
- Press reported: Head of Al-Qaeda in Karachi captured during planning meetings
- Adams: "Can we meet him?"
- Started debriefing Al-Qaeda's head of Karachi
- He confirmed Dawood Badini's house location from 2002-2003 intelligence

**The Capture Operation:**
- Movement intelligence: Younis going to southern Pakistan, then boat to Africa

- Only information: Someone named "Dawood" would move him
- Adams selected: **Dawood Badini** (KSM's brother-in-law)
- Used decade-old CIA debriefing intelligence
- Had Al-Qaeda Karachi leader verify location
- Staged at Badini's house
- **Younis was three blocks away**
- Capture successful

**Verification by Infiltration:**
- ISI: "It's Eid this week, come next week for debriefing"
- Adams: "I'm just going to show up and be dumb"
- First day of Eid (Monday), drove to ISI compound
- Found detainee debriefing room, turned on CCTV
- **Younis appeared on TV**
- Reported to station: "He's in Islamabad"
- Next week: ISI pretended he wasn't even in city yet
- Had spent whole week debriefing him

### January 2012: Sarah Adams Arrives in Libya

**Deployment:**
- Adams arrives in Libya post-Gaddafi

- Multiple threat indicators building

### September 9, 2012: Militia Security Withdrawal

**Critical Warning Sign - Two Days Before Attack**

Three most powerful militias in Benghazi withdraw security:

1. **17th February Brigade**
   - U.S. paying them for consulate protection
   - Explicitly stated: "We're not going to protect you and moves anymore"
   - This why Boon and others extended stays to provide security

2. **Rafallah al-Sahati**
   - Commander of Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi
   - Senior leader in terrorist network

3. **Third militia** (unspecified)

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Ambassador Stevens' trip should have been canceled
- All three biggest militias refusing security = clear threat
- **"Nobody pieced it together"**

---

## Benghazi Attacks - Detailed Timeline (September 11-12, 2012)

### Planning and Command Structure

**Supreme Command**
- **Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri** (Head of Al-Qaeda)
  - Directly orchestrated the operation
  - Personal motivation: Two deputies killed in Pakistan drone strikes
  - After second strike (June 2011): "Enough's enough, we're going to take it to the Americans in Libya"

**Operational Command Chain**
1. **Droukdel** (AQIM leader) - received orders from Zawahiri
2. **Mokhtar Belmokhtar (MBM)** - kidnapping expert, designated mastermind
3. Both very close to Zawahiri

**Additional Support**
- **AQAP (Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula):**
  - Helped fund the operation
  - Issued fatwa making attack legally permissible
- **Egypt-based operatives:**
  - Zawahiri reached out to multiple people in Egypt
  - One just released from prison with Zawahiri's brother
  - Negotiating to set up Al-Qaeda in Egypt
  - Benghazi designated as his first operation

**Ground Command**
- **Omar al-Shalali** (Adel's brother)
  - Attack commander on ground
  - AQIM's head for Libya 2012

### Attack Objectives

**Primary Goal: Kidnapping Operation**
- Target: Ambassador Stevens
- **NOT a killing operation**
- Purpose: Prison swaps for terrorist releases

**Target Prisoners for Exchange:**
1. **Adel al-Shalali** (Primary) - Libyan on death row in Iraq, Zarqawi's close friend
2. **The Blind Sheikh** (Omar Abdel-Rahman)
3. **Abu Faraj al-Libi** (Guantanamo)
4. **Aafia Siddiqui** (believed in Texas)

**Precedent Set:**
Three weeks before Benghazi: Al-Qaeda kidnapped only Quds Force officer in Benghazi, demanded five Al-Qaeda in Iraq detainees.

### Attack Force Composition

**Total Force: 150 Terrorists**
- **75 terrorists:** Direct assault on compound
- **75 terrorists:** Cordoned off surrounding streets
- **Minimum 50 confirmed Al-Qaeda members**
- Remaining: Al-Qaeda affiliates

**Combat Experience of Force:**
- Soviet-Afghan War (Mujahideen era)
- Algerian Civil War (200,000 civilians killed)
- Iraq Wars (2003-2004 onward)
- Libyan Revolution (most recent)
- Post-Benghazi: Syria

**Leadership Quality:**
- Almost every senior leader had long-established relationships with Zawahiri, Bin Laden, or Zarqawi
- **One exception:** MBM recruited fluent English-speaking businessman when took over Algerian village
  - Made him commander specifically for English skills
  - Role: Communicate with Ambassador during captivity
  - Two Canadians also recruited as English speakers for shifts

### September 11, 2012 - Consulate Attack

**9:42 PM: Attack Begins**
- 150 terrorists assault diplomatic compound

**9:48 PM: CIA Receives Call**
- State Department compound calls for help
- **GRS team visible on cameras sitting in cars, ready to depart**
- Waiting for orders

**~10:00 PM: First Fire Started**
- Fire at guard shack inside consulate

**The 17-Minute Delay That Killed**

**Bob (CIA Chief of Base) Critical Failures:**

1. **The Phone Call:**
   - Bob calls **Fawzi Bukatef** (head of 17th February Brigade)
   - Response: "I'm not sending you any help. I don't have any help to send you. I'm not sending you any help tonight."
   - 17th February had sent ~25 terrorists to participate in attacks
   - Brigade commander wouldn't send people to attack his own terrorists

2. **The Lie:**
   - Bob lied to GRS team
   - Told them: "We're waiting on 17th February to respond"
   - Claimed he spent time "begging them"
   - Knew from first call they weren't responding
   - **"17th February never responded with even one body to the Benghazi attacks"**

3. **What Broke the Impasse:**
   - State Department officer: "If you don't come now we're going to die"
   - GRS team said "screw it" and left
   - **Bob could have held them there all night by continuing to lie**

**~10:05 PM: GRS Finally Departs (23 minutes after attack began)**
- Left CIA Annex for State compound

**~10:07 PM: GRS Arrives at Compound (2-3 minute trip)**

**~10:10 PM: Terrorists Reach Ambassador's Villa**
- Cannot initially gain entry
- **Begin setting fire to Ambassador's villa**

**Critical Timing Analysis:**
- GRS ready to leave: 9:48 PM
- Fire on villa started: ~10:10 PM
- **"Mathematically they would have been there before the fire started - they wouldn't even have to put out a fire"**
- **The 17-minute delay (9:48 to 10:05) was the difference between prevention and response**

**Result: First Two Deaths**
- **Ambassador Chris Stevens** (smoke inhalation)
- **Sean Smith** (State Department Information Management Officer)

### September 11-12, 2012: CIA Annex Attack (Separate Operation)

**Background: This Was NOT Part of Al-Qaeda's Plan**

- Wasam: "What the fuck? There's more Americans coming to Benghazi?"
- **"He kind of lost it on the phone"**

**The Overheard Conversation:**
- Someone nearby overheard Wasam after phone call
- Quote: **"I'm going to kill all the Americans tonight"**
- This when he formulated mortar attack plan

**The Setup:**
1. Sent commander to airport to intercept Team Tripoli
2. Purpose: Hold them to buy time for mortar setup

**September 12, 2012 - Early Morning**

**~1:30 AM: Team Tripoli Arrives Benghazi Airport**

- Waiting for Wasam's call

**5:05 AM: The Release**
- Wasam calls commander: "Let them go"
- CIA officer overheard in real time: "Wasam bin Hamid said we can go now"

**5:05 AM: Team Tripoli Arrives at CIA Annex**
- Commander who escorted them enters building
- Inside: Bob, CIA personnel, GRS team lead
- Wasam calls commander's fighters outside
- Orders them to abandon building immediately
- Fighter: "I can't leave my commander inside"
- Wasam: "I don't care about your commander, leave"
- Forces abandon building

**5:17 AM: First Mortar Hits CIA Annex**
- **12 minutes after Team Tripoli arrival**

**Deaths from Mortar Attack:**
- **Tyrone Woods** (former Navy SEAL, GRS contractor)
- **Glen Doherty** (former Navy SEAL, GRS contractor)

**The Unwitting Commander:**
- Had no idea he was being used for terrorist attack
- Thought he was helping Americans
- Abandoned by his own forces on Wasam's orders

### Military and Government Response Failures

**Department of Defense Positioning:**
- **"DOD was not positioned to respond and it's sad. They're supposed to be."**
- September 11 is known high-risk date
- No heightened military readiness

**AFRICOM Structure Issues:**
- Supposed to be EUCOM and AFRICOM
- AFRICOM wasn't set up yet
- Only EUCOM CIF existed, covering both areas
- **This single CIF was on training mission in Croatia**

**The CIF (Commander's In-Extremis Force) Problem:**
- Location: Croatia (training mission)
- **Didn't even have their airplane with them**
- Airplane at Aviano base in Italy had to fly to Croatia to pick them up
- Took 12 hours of mandatory crew rest
- Loaded plane, flew to Italy
- **Never reached Libya**

**Two Teams Deployed - Both to Wrong Location:**
1. CIF from Croatia
2. Team from North Carolina

- Both flew to **Italy** (not Libya where attack was)
- Arrived within 2 hours of each other
- **"I'd be pissed if I was them if I landed. I'm in Italy, I'm like why am I not landing in Libya."**
- Military personnel were indeed "pissed"

**5:00 AM Directive - After Last Attack:**
- First order came at 5:00 AM
- Last attack: 5:17 AM
- **Nothing deploys to Benghazi**
- **All resources directed to Tripoli**

**The Facebook Threat Diversion:**
- Unverified Facebook page posted threat against Tripoli Embassy
- Not from page "US was really tracking"
- "Nothing" as credible intelligence
- Yet all attention shifted to Tripoli

**CIA Information Sharing Failure:**
- At State compound: Constant updates, information well shared
- After moving to CIA compound: **"No one in CIA is sharing"**
- GRS Team Lead called attack **"pop shots"**
- Severe minimization of threat
- When Facebook threat emerged, decision-makers had inadequate information

**FAST Team Deployment Issues:**
- Originally planned: Deployment to Tripoli only (by ~1:00 AM)
- **Hillary Clinton changed FAST team four times**
- Debates: uniforms, aircraft type, diplomatic clearances

**The Reality:**
- **General Housi** (Libyan Air Force head) gave blanket authority immediately
- Quote: "Send in what you want, do what you want, you have free reign"
- Full flight clearances from beginning
- No restrictions on uniforms, planes, anything
- **All debates were unnecessary**

**Fighter Jets:**
- **Never even considered**
- No fighter support planned

**French and Qatari Resources Available:**
- French Special Forces based in Libya
- French had fighter jets in region
- 50 Qatari Special Forces in Tripoli
- None utilized

**Obama's Actions:**
1. Told Secretary of Defense: "Use all means to do this"
2. **Got on plane to Las Vegas to see Beyoncé and Jay-Z**
- Attack ongoing when he flew
- Did not cancel trip
- Did not stay to ensure orders followed
- No maintained command presence

### The False Narrative - Video Lie

**Jake Sullivan's Creation**
- Current position (2023): National Security Advisor
- Created false video narrative

**Video Background:**
- Originally came out Spring 2011
- Translated version: August 2012
- Title: "Innocence of Muslims" (anti-Islamic video)

**Egypt Protest:**
- Planned for August, moved to September 11
- Organizers said would "also talk about this video"
- Video "kind of got wrapped in"

**Critical Connection:**
- Protest organizers were Benghazi planners:
  1. **Al-Zawahiri's brother**
  2. **Mokhtar Salem** (famous commander, oversaw Bamiyan Buddha destruction)
- **"They're the ones hosting this protest in Egypt. They know there's a planned attack in Benghazi when they're hosting it."**

**Narrative Creation:**
- Jake Sullivan decides to use video as fake narrative
- Administration runs with it
- **It worked**

**How It Went Viral:**
- Administration uses video narrative (day of attack)
- Becomes news
- **Video went viral September 13 (two days AFTER attack)**
- Only viral "because of the policy makers"
- Created self-fulfilling prophecy

**Intelligence Community Failure - NSA Report:**
- NSA wrote report on Benghazi
- **Cut and pasted comment from press** (not intelligence)
- Report stated: "At 5:00 PM there were protests in Benghazi"
- **Two errors:**
  1. NOTHING at 5:00 PM in Benghazi
  2. 5:00 PM timeframe was **Cairo**, not Benghazi
- Despite being from press, marked **Top Secret SCI**
- Analysts took this comment, elevated it as highest classified intelligence
- Policy makers read it: "Oh that's top secret evidence"

**What Administration Knew:**
- Hillary Clinton sent email to daughter stating it was Al-Qaeda
- "She knew in real time it was terrorist"
- Had proof of terrorist attack

**When Evidence Presented:**
- Adams and others: "We have evidence there was no protest"
- **Administration response: Didn't change it**
- "Everybody was marching along with what administration wanted"

**Who Pushed False Narrative:**
- **Jake Sullivan** - created it
- **Ben Rhodes** - wrote messaging, Susan Rice talking points, Obama/Clinton statements
- **Obama** - made statement
- **Hillary Clinton** - made statement, apologized for video
- **Susan Rice** - talk show appearances (Ben Rhodes' talking points)

### Bob's Repercussions (or Lack Thereof)

**Bob's Background:**
- Started as CIA medic (not case officer)
- Spent entire career at "the farm" (training facility)
- First war zone: Eastern Afghanistan
  - Got his asset killed
  - Attempted money payoff cover-up
  - Sent home
- Second war zone: Benghazi (only other deployment)

**Consequences for Failures:**
- **None - received rewards instead:**
- Given "most senior award in the CIA"
- Benghazi supposed to be last trip before retirement
- Because of accolades, sent back to farm as trainer
- Last known position: Trainer at farm
- Quote: "Fuck up, move up"

**Congressional Investigation:**
- Congress asked Bob about his actions
- Never held accountable

### Sarah Adams' Experience That Night

**Her Location:**
- Adams in Benghazi that day
- **Flew to London for meeting, missing entirety of attack**
- Later questioned by Congressional staffer if she "found out about attack and left"
- Adams rejected implication: "We were all family"

**End of November 2012:**
- Adams leaves Libya

### Wasam bin Hamid's Later Career

**Post-Benghazi Rise:**
- "Did so well in this attack he eventually became al-Qaeda head for Benghazi"

**Benghazi War (2014-2017):**
- Huge war in Benghazi
- Wasam took over late 2014/early 2015
- AQIM head issued call: "Go to Benghazi and fight with Wasam"
- **It worked** - survived another 14 months from international reinforcements

**Death:**
- Libyan National Army with UAE support conducted mortar strike
- Wasam hit, suffered ~10 days and died
- Al-Qaeda lied about death "a few weeks" - feared fighters would give up
- After truth came out: **Benghazi fell, Al-Qaeda lost its base**
- **Haven't gotten it back since**

**Hamas Connection:**
- When Wasam died, multiple people called family
- **Head of Hamas called**
- **Abdullah Azzam's son called** ("Godfather of al-Qaeda")

---

## Post-Benghazi Period (2013-2019)

### 2013: Taliban Political Office Established

**Qatar Office Opening**
- Taliban political office established in Qatar
- **U.S. funding begins: At least $10 million per month**
- Operating expenses paid by U.S.
- **Continuous funding from 2013 to present (11+ years)**
- Separate from weekly Kabul deliveries

### 2014: Benghazi War Begins

**War Duration: 2014-2017**
- Wasam bin Hamid takes over al-Qaeda Benghazi (late 2014/early 2015)
- General Haftar leads Libyan National Army against terrorists
- International terrorists pour in to support Wasam

**Casualties:**
- **8,000 soldiers killed**
- **20,000 civilians killed**
- Demonstrates Al-Qaeda power level reached from late 2011 to 2014

**Power Level Comparison:**
- October 2011: Gaddafi falls
- November 2011: Al-Qaeda enters Benghazi
- By 2014: Powerful enough to fight 3-year war killing 28,000 total

**This Timeline Becomes Template for Afghanistan:**
- Shows how fast Al-Qaeda can regenerate and gain power
- Libya model predicts Afghanistan trajectory post-2021

### January 2017: Benghazi War Ends

**Fall of Benghazi:**
- Wasam bin Hamid killed in mortar strike
- Suffered ~10 days before dying
- Al-Qaeda lied about death for weeks
- Once truth known: Benghazi fell
- Al-Qaeda lost base, haven't regained

### 2015: Sarah Adams Joins Benghazi Committee

**Recruitment:**
- **Trey Gowdy** recruits Adams from CIA
- Position: Executive appointment on Select Committee on Benghazi
- Contact: "Some of the guys from Benghazi gave Trey my phone number"

**First Response:**
- Adams: "Hell no"
- Had just read horrible Benghazi report (thought it was Gowdy's)
- Was actually **Mike Rogers'** report
- Boon advised: "If he comes around again, have a discussion"

**Second Contact:**
- Gowdy: "Will you come sit with my staff?"
- Adams flies to DC
- After meeting: "I just don't think this is for me"
- Gowdy: **"I'll let you live in Tampa"**
- Adams: "Okay, now we're speaking"

**Democrat Opposition Campaign:**
- **Trey wanted bipartisan cooperation**
- Never asked Adams' political party
- **On paper Adams was registered Democrat**
- Democrats discovered this
- **"Came at me like there's no tomorrow"**

**Their Theory:**
- Trey hired Democrat to cover up "covert action stuff"
- Claimed: **Benghazi Annex moving weapons to Syria**
- Adams' rebuttal: "If moving weapons to Syria don't need crappy little Annex in Benghazi, just take them to Turkey"

**The Stinger Confusion:**
- People confused weapons in Libya
- **Zero Stingers in all of Libya**
- Libya had: **Russian SA-7s, SA-9s from Gaddafi**
- U.S. trying to recover them so terrorists don't get them

**Democrat Obstruction:**
1. **Barred from working** - first two months couldn't access systems
2. **CIA removal attempt** - went to CIA to have Adams removed
   - CIA lawyers: "It's completely logical he'd hire someone who worked Benghazi"
   - CIA: **"We see no conflict"**
3. **Threatened report release** - about Adams' time in Africa
4. **Elijah Cummings intervened** - told staff "This is foolish," stopped attacks

**Abu Anas al-Libi Controversy:**
- Mastermind of Kenya/Tanzania embassy bombings
- Target in Tripoli
- Detained in Iran for years, released dying
- Adams: "On death's doorstep"
- COSOS wanted capture, Adams refused: "He's going to die in our custody"
- After Adams left, others captured him
- **Died in U.S. custody before trial**
- **Given liver transplant** - "could have gone to American"

### The Elevator Moment - The Discovery

**Month Three - Finally Working:**
- Adams visiting CIA
- In elevator with Benghazi committee people
- Analyst Adams knew stepped on
- "In shop that should be working Benghazi"
- "One of the best analysts I knew"

**The Conversation:**
- Analyst: "What are you working on now?"
- Adams: "The Benghazi committee"
- Analyst: **"I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole"**

**Adams' Realization:**
- "This guy was the best, got great integrity, hard worker"
- "In shop that would be working Benghazi"
- **"Won't touch it, they're not doing it"**

**The Phone Call:**
- Called Boon leaving CIA
- **"The CIA is not going after the Benghazi attackers"**
- Boon: "They must be"
- Adams: **"No. That's why we haven't seen anything. They're not going after them."**
- **"That's the day we decided to do our own investigation and track them down ourselves"**

### 2016: Adams Leaves Committee

**Reflections:**
- "Congress doesn't have a lot of teeth"
- "They write great reports. But what's it do?"
- "They don't use the carrots and sticks they need"
- "Never actually force people to make change"

**Would She Do It Again?**
- **"Only for the fact it was the only way I realized CIA wasn't working on Benghazi attackers"**
- **"100% it was worth that one minute in the elevator"**
- Otherwise: "Not really, it was just a waste of time"

### 2017-2019: Benghazi Attackers Status

**Ongoing Investigation:**
- Adams and team independently investigating
- Finding attackers ignored by U.S. government
- Some killed by French forces
- Some killed by Libyan National Army
- Many remain at large, especially in Afghanistan

**July 2018: Visa Scandal**

- Multimillionaire terrorist financier in Turkey
- Profile stated joined ISIS in 2015
- Known al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliated
- **Visa was granted**
- Went to airport to fly to America
- **Turkish authorities stopped him** - on Turkish list
- U.S. didn't stop him, Turkey did
- Adams: "Are you serious? This wasn't some long time ago. 2018."

### 2019: Hamza bin Laden "Death"

**Official U.S. Narrative:**
- Hamza bin Laden reported dead in strike
- U.S. maintains this position

**Five Months Later:**
- Afghan officials reportedly found he didn't die
- Provided picture to U.S. government
- Where picture went: unknown

**September 2021:**
- Person ensuring information got out that Hamza alive
- **"Captured, tortured, and killed by Taliban"**

## Afghanistan Withdrawal and Aftermath (August 2021 - Present)

### August 15, 2021: The Abandonment

**U.S. Abandons President Saleh and 98-99% of Intelligence Assets:**
- Afghanistan falls to Taliban
- President Ashraf Ghani flees to Dubai
- **Saleh does NOT flee**
- Goes to Panjshir Valley (only province not fallen to Taliban)
- Declares national resistance against Taliban
- According to Articles 60 and 67 of Constitution: Became Acting President
- U.S. abandons 98-99% of human intelligence assets built over 20 years

**Scott Mann Assessment:**
> "98 to 99% of the human intelligence assets in Afghanistan that took 20 years to build were left behind"

**Veterans Fill the Gap:**
- No formal intelligence agency picked up these relationships
- Veterans maintained contacts for "primarily humanitarian reasons"
- Four years later: "High veracity intelligence and reporting coming through these channels instead of formal channels"

## Afghanistan Withdrawal - Day by Day (August 2021)

### Pre-Withdrawal Context

**Doha Agreement:**
- Secret annexes never released
- "Congress needs to release them"
- Included funding commitments to Taliban
- Weekly payments established

### July 1, 2021: Bagram Abandoned

**The Abandonment**
- **U.S. snuck out of Bagram Air Base in middle of night**
- Did not tell commander of Bagram of departure
- Commander arrived in morning
- Taliban and terrorists breaking prisoners out

**Abbey Gate Bomber Released**
- **Name:** Abdul Rahim Sangari (not Abdul Rahman al-Logari as CENTCOM stated)
- Released from Bagram this day
- **Background:**
  - 2017: ISIS deployed him to New Delhi, India
  - Cover: Engineering student
  - Cased targets: Airport, shopping mall, others
  - 2017: Captured by Indians or CIA
  - 2017-2021: Held in Bagram prison

**Chinese and Iranian Assistance:**
- Help Taliban get biometric systems working
- Deploy on mobile devices at borders and checkpoints

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
- "That's the day we decided to do our own investigation"

### August 2021: Kabul Falls and Evacuation Crisis

**August 13, 2021: NEO Announced**
- U.S. announces Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation
- Taliban and ISIS-K leadership learn timeline

**August 15, 2021**
- Abdul Rahim Sangari released from Bagram
- 2 days after NEO announcement
- Kabul falls to Taliban

**August 18, 2021: Abbey Gate Planning Meeting**
- **Location:** Kandahar, Afghanistan
- **3 days after Sangari's release**
- Senior ISIS-K and Haqqani leadership present
- Attack planned in this meeting
- **Same location later used for October 7th planning**

**August 21, 2021: Gate Security Arranged**
- Haqqani Network chooses three senior commanders
- Their role: Man gates and allow bomber through

**August 23, 2021: Security Forces Shifted**
- Taliban shift security from North Gate to Abbey Gate
- Deliberately concentrating forces where bombing planned
- Goal: Maximize casualties

**August 25, 2021: U.S. Threat Warning**
- U.S. issues warning about suicide bomber
- Warning came too late to change operations

**August 26, 2021: Abbey Gate Attack**

**Attack Details:**
- **Over 170 Afghans killed**
- **13 U.S. service members killed**
- Tyler Vargas Andrews (Marine) had bomber in sights
- Haqqani Network controlled all external security
- Deliberately concentrated casualties

**Command Structure:**

**ISIS Khorasan Province:**

- **New leader:** Sultan Aziz Azam (aka "Sanaullah"/"Sa'ad")
- Sa'ad: Haqqani Network member since 2012
- Was head of Haqqani Network in Kabul
- **Demonstrates Haqqani control of ISIS-K**

**Haqqani Network:**
- **Sirajuddin Haqqani:** Overall leader, approved operation
- Three senior commanders at gates
- **Hafiz Zahir Hamidi:** Told bomber "you're in a good spot now, blow"

**12 Terrorists Identified Total:**
- 7 Haqqani Network members
- 5 ISIS members

**Timeline Summary:**
- August 13: NEO announced
- August 15: Bomber released
- August 18: Bomber in planning meeting (3 days after release)
- August 26: Attack executed
- **Only 11 days from release to attack**

**CENTCOM Investigation Failure:**
- Duration: 3.5 years
- Released: April 2024
- 12-person panel
- **Result:** Never identified bomber's true name
- **After 3.5 years stated: "Abdul Rahman al-Logari - that's a Kunya or alias"**

**Sarah Adams' Investigation:**
- Started: April 2024
- Released: August 2024
- Duration: 4 months
- **Result: Found true name - Abdul Rahim Sangari**

### Evacuation Issues

**State Department Control:**
- "This was State Department run"
- Military: "We were just following State NEO rules"
- No accountability for State Department

**CIA Gate Takeover:**
- CIA "probably only real government organization moving people out"
- "Taking our allies out, doing the right thing"
- **State Department took over CIA's gate**
- Reason: "Didn't like what they were doing, that they were bringing people in"
- Adams got family to CIA gate after bombing
- State Department person running it, preventing CIA from bringing people

**Government Intentions:**
- "Government just wanted to get out of Afghanistan"
- "Thought they were going to get away with it"
- "Just wanted to leave and be done"

**Unexpected Resistance:**
- Never expected 20 years of veterans/intel officers would go back
- "We got in their way, like in a bad way"
- Government plan: "We left 100 Americans behind"
- Volunteers compiled data: **"8,000 Americans left behind"**

**Afghan Evac Coalition Created:**
- Government response to quiet dissenting voices
- Partnership between government and NGOs
- **"Not all of us are part of it"**
- Moral Compass Federation: "Rogue entity to the side"
- Must sign "tons of NDAs"
- Adams left after third NDA
- Purpose: "Keep volunteer groups in line, make them mentally happy"
- "Cover to drag out the evac 100%"
- Two years later (2023): Still meeting monthly

**Kabul Airport Atrocities:**
- Taliban controlled external security
- Taliban taunts witnessed by U.S. military
- "Grab a woman and shoot her in the head"
- "Burn a child alive in front of the military"
- Taliban knew U.S. military "couldn't act"
- Videos of torture deaths sent to Americans

### Post-Withdrawal Casualties

**Afghan Allies - The Numbers (as of late 2023):**

**Total:** 200,000 Afghan military and police worked with U.S.

**Killed:** Just over 10,000 (in 2.5 years)
- Context: Under 2,500 Americans died in 20+ years
- 10,000 Afghan allies in 2.5 years

**Captured:** 30,000
- 18,000 went through "fake justice system" (Taliban Sharia Court)
- Prison sentence or executed
- **12,000 completely missing**

**Missing Status Unknown:** 12,000 (dead, tortured, secret prisons)

**Total Missing Afghans:** 70,000 (including non-allies)
- Disappeared when Taliban came
- Never seen again
- Families never notified

**Secret Prisons:**
- GDI has secret prisons
- Ministry of Interior has secret prison
- Ministry of Defense has secret prisons
- Bagram base secret prison
- Helmand secret prison

**Women Casualties (last 2.5 years):**
- 880,000 women reported rapes
- 15,000 children reported rapes
- Note: Most "prisoners in own house, can't report"

**Women's Status:**
- When Afghanistan fell: 27% of Parliament was women
- United States: 29%
- "Got to equal par to us in 20 years"
- Current status: Zero rights, living in prison

### Biometric Systems - Hunting Allies

**U.S. Left Behind:**
- Complete biometric database
- Location: Ministry of Interior building

**Taliban Strategy:**
- Take property, homes, businesses, land
- Cut power (some cut 2 years ago, refuse to restore)

**Initial Period:**
- First year Taliban didn't have biometrics working
- Faked it (like theme park fake fingerprint reader)

**Chinese and Iranian Help:**
- Got system working
- Deploy on mobile devices

**Current Deployment:**
- Border crossings
- Checkpoints

**Warning to Afghans:**
- If went through border 6 months after fall and were fine
- Don't assume fine now
- System wasn't working then, is now

**Databases Working:**
- Entire passport database
- Entire criminal database
- Entire police system (Ministry of Interior and Army)
- Entire pay system for NDS (Afghan CIA)
- Entire pay system for Supreme Court

**Targeting Method:**
- Using pay systems to find allies
- "They know they have right guy because tied to payroll"
- Can change name but fingerprint reveals identity

**Assessment:**
- "Greatest case of targeting I've ever seen"
- Fully running for at least 6 months
- **"These guys don't have a chance. We left them for slaughter."**

### Intelligence Asset Betrayal - The Phone Number Story

**The Promise:**
- CIA gave asset a phone number
- Told to call when reaching Kabul airport
- "We'll get you evacuated"

**What Happened:**
- **One-way number to voicemail answering service**
- No human ever answers
- Asset called repeatedly
- No one ever called back
- **"Then one day they turned it off"**
- No way to ever re-contact

**Result:**
- Asset stranded in Afghanistan
- CIA has no way to reconnect
- Even if wanted to, burned the bridge
- Impossible to rebuild trust

**Current Reality:**
- Former assets collecting information
- Won't share with U.S.
- **Will share with Israel instead**
- "We'll never pass it to the United States"
- Scott Mann assessment: "Allies we abandoned hate the CIA"

**Collection Loss:**
- "99% of intelligence collection" lost (Adams' estimate)
- Rely on Taliban for information (enemies)
- Cannot verify anything
- No independent sources
- No way to rebuild quickly

## Syrian Blitzkrieg Planning and Execution (November 2021 - November 2024)

### November 2021: Syrian Blitzkrieg Planning Meeting in Kandahar, Afghanistan

**Location:** Afghanistan (planning began immediately following Afghanistan's fall to Taliban)

**Key Planners:**
1. **Abu Muhammad Al-Julani** (current president of Syria) - Traveled to Afghanistan
2. **Musa bin Ali** (Benghazi plotter, Al-Qaeda operative)
3. **Sirajuddin Haqqani** (Minister of Interior, Afghanistan)
4. **Mullah Yaqub** (Minister of Defense, Afghanistan)

**The Meeting:**
- Goal: "Do in Syria what happened in Afghanistan"
- Problem: Julani's camps outside Al-Alom Military Base in Syria being bombed
- Couldn't safely train there
- Solution: Taliban provided training camps in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan

**The Commitment:**
- Julani requested 10,000 fighters
- Al-Qaeda committed to training 10,000 fighters in Afghanistan
- These fighters in addition to Julani's own trainees
- Training conducted over 2-3 years (2021-2024)

### 2021-2024: Al-Qaeda Trains 10,000 Fighters for Syria

**Training Infrastructure:**
- Location: Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan
- Provided by: Taliban
- Conducted by: Al-Qaeda
- Duration: 2-3 years
- Number: 10,000 fighters specifically for Syrian operation
- In addition to Julani's own training operations

**Current Status (after Syrian takeover):**
- Musa bin Ali runs large terrorist training camp in Libya south of Misrata with Julani

### November 2024: Syrian Blitzkrieg Executed Successfully

**The Attack:**
- Julani takes over Syria
- 10,000 Al-Qaeda-trained fighters from Afghanistan deployed
- Taliban fighters in Syria right now
- Taliban members supported Julani during takeover

**U.S. Response:**
- State Department removes $10 million bounty on Julani "in a matter of minutes"
- Rewards for Justice website page on Julani disappeared
- "He was a terrorist on Monday evening, he was no longer a terrorist"
- U.S. Department of Defense taking out Julani's rivals for last month
- U.S. consolidating power for the terrorist

**Current Plan for Syria:**
- Ethnic cleansing: Christians, Alawites, Kurds, "any minority"
- Goal: Islamic caliphate (Sharia law)
- Same model as Afghanistan Taliban

### The Disarmament Trap (Post-Takeover)

**Julani's Registration Scheme:**
- Required weapons be turned in
- Required registration
- "Be part of this new democracy, this inclusive government"

**Results:**
- Christians and Alawites turned in weapons
- West was pushing this narrative
- U.S. think tanks urged Kurds to turn in weapons

**Kurdish Response:**
- Kurds refused to turn in weapons
- Still armed and defending themselves
- Still being attacked by Turkish government
- But not defenseless like other groups

### Christian Persecution in Syria (November 2024 - Present)

**Scale of Killings:**
- "In the thousands"
- Exact numbers very limited due to terrorist-run government
- Only seeing "maybe 10% of the numbers"

**Methods of Execution:**
- Beheadings
- Bodies dumped in rivers
- Children put in cages and drowned in river
- Women taken as sex slaves
- Burning alive: Putting people in cages, setting them on fire
- Going through demographic group by group

**Legend's Intelligence:**
> "There are Taliban fighters in Syria, there are Taliban members that supported Julani during his takeover of Syria just a few months ago and there are Taliban fighters in Syria right now currently at the moment"

## October 7th Planning and Execution (2022-2023)

### March 2022: Planning Begins

**Context:**
- Russia invaded Ukraine (February 2022)
- Terrorists believe world focus on Ukraine creates opportunity

**Russia Contacted:**
- Terrorists reach out to Russia: "Is timing okay?"
- **Russia response: "Go for it, go for it, go for it"**
- Russia wanted distraction from Ukraine war

**Original Target Date:**
- **October 7, 2022** (one year earlier than actual attack)

### Date Significance

**October 7, 2001:**
- Operation Enduring Freedom announced
- George Bush announced operation
- **U.S. began carpet bombing Kandahar**
- **This connects October 7th directly to Afghanistan**

**Most Americans Don't Know:**
- Why this date chosen
- Afghanistan connection
- Just as most don't know why 9/11 was September 11, 1922

**Implication:**
- Terrorists choose dates based on historical significance to them
- Many potential dates from:
  - 20 years Afghanistan/Iraq wars
  - Syria war events
  - Terrorist martyrs
  - Historical grievances 100+ years back

### July 31, 2022: Zawahiri Killed - Attack Delayed

**The Strike:**
- U.S. drone strike killed Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul
- Staying at house owned by Sirajuddin Haqqani
- Haqqanis long suspected of hosting Zawahiri

**Al-Qaeda Reaction:**
- Feared U.S. would bomb all Afghanistan locations
- Worried about losing base/safe haven
- Reached out to Russia requesting continued pressure for 2022 attack

**Russia's Response:**
- "No, do it in 2022, don't wait"
- "I need pressure off me for Ukraine"

**Al-Qaeda Decision:**
- Delayed to 2023 anyway (their decision)
- **Attack delayed exactly one year**
- Gave attackers additional year of training (beneficial)

**Zawahiri Death Questions:**
- 14 months after reported death (as of October 2023)
- **Al-Qaeda has not officially eulogized him**
- Al-Qaeda never fakes eulogies
- "Very odd that they haven't eulogized him"
- Adams suspicious he may still be alive
- **"Until I see Al-Qaeda eulogize him I'm having a hard time believing he's dead"**

**Current Al-Qaeda Leadership:**
- Has not publicly named next leader
- Chosen de facto leader exists but unusual situation
- Described as "leading military side of Al-Qaeda"
- "Strange de facto" leadership

### Training Timeline

**August 7, 2022: Training Begins**
- **Date significance:** Anniversary of 1998 Tanzania/Kenya embassy bombings

**Originally Planned:**
- 500 fighters
- 2 months training (August 7 - October 7, 2022)

**Actually Occurred:**
- 1,500 fighters
- Over 1 year training (August 2022 - October 2023)
- Delay improved training quality

**Training Location:**
- Afghanistan camps
- 30 Al-Qaeda training camps total (7 suicide bomber specific)

### Planning Locations and Methods

**Primary Meetings:**

1. **First Meeting: Kandahar, Afghanistan**
   - Key decision maker: **Saif al-Adel** (Al-Qaeda military commission head)
   - **Chose the date: October 7th**
   - Selected for Afghanistan connection

2. **Second Meeting: Kabul, Afghanistan**
   - Refinement of operational details

3. **Subsequent Planning:**
   - Primarily via Telegram
   - Demonstrates vulnerability in communications
   - Should have been interceptable

### Key Participants and Roles

**Al-Qaeda:**
- Overall operational planning
- **Saif al-Adel:** Military commission leader, date selection
- Training camp provision
- Command and control

**Taliban:**
- **Hibatullah Akhundzada (Supreme Leader):** **Issued fatwa authorizing attack**
- Provided training camps
- Logistical support
- Coordination

**Iran/IRGC:**
- **Mohammad Kazemi:** Key plotter, operations coordinator
  - Head of IRGC Intelligence Organization
  - Previously protected Al-Qaeda leaders in Iran
  - Also masterminding Soleimani assassination revenge plot
  - **Not on FBI Most Wanted List** (major intelligence failure)
- **Qasem Soleimani:** Planned before death, his infrastructure used
- Various IRGC generals: Go-ahead authority
- Internal Iranian military units

**Hamas:**
- Ground execution force
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Received training in Afghanistan
- Operational direction from Al-Qaeda/Taliban/Iran coordination

### October 7, 2023: Attack Executed

**Scale:**
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Trained in Afghanistan
- October 7th-style coordinated attacks
- Based on 2008 Mumbai attack model

**Tactics:**
- Swarming attacks (multiple simultaneous targets)
- Suicide bombers and fedayeen fighters
- Real-time intelligence and coordination
- Target changes during operation
- Extended engagement (fight to death)

**Result:**
- Large number killed
- Israel unprepared despite warnings
- Same pattern U.S. currently experiencing

### Warning Signs Ignored

**Information Passed to Israel:**
- People observed Hamas training in Afghanistan
- Reports provided to Israeli government before attack
- Israel knew Hamas planning "some big plot" in Afghanistan
- No action taken

**Adams' Warning:**
- "I worry because same things being passed to our government"
- "They're not taking it serious"
- "I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice"
- "We're making the same mistake"

**Foreign Intelligence Confirmation:**
- European intelligence service contacted Adams
- Message: "Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."
- Foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question: Does U.S. have it and not preparing?

### October 7th as Template for U.S.

**Why It Matters:**
- First in series targeting Israel, Europe, United States
- "Test run" for tactics to be used in U.S.
- Same planning structure
- Same coordination methods
- Same attack style prepared for U.S.

**Training Correlation:**
- U.S. homeland attackers received similar training
- Advanced urban warfare
- Suicide bombing techniques
- Cover and covert operations
- Same camps, instructors, methods

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "Everybody who's like why do we care about Israel"
- "That's just the first in series coming for us"
- "That's like the test run"

### Why Most Americans Don't Know

**U.S. Press:**
- Has not covered Al-Qaeda/Taliban involvement
- No major U.S. media reporting
- Information available in British, European, Indian, African press
- Not in American media

**U.S. Government:**
- Not preparing law enforcement
- Not sharing threat information
- **Governor Ron DeSantis: "I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from federal government"**
- State and local law enforcement unaware

**Consequences:**
- First responders unprepared for tactics
- No training for October 7th-style attacks
- Cannot prepare defenses
- Same pattern as Israel before attack

## Islamic Army Formation (2022-2024)

### Formation Timeline

**Last Two Years (2022-2024):**
- Created under Hamza bin Laden's leadership
- Fulfills Osama bin Laden's original vision
- Now operational reality, not just aspiration
- Most significant development in global terrorism structure

### Leadership Structure

**Overall Leader:**
- **Hamza bin Laden**
  - Son of Osama bin Laden
  - Currently in Afghanistan
  - U.S. falsely claims he's dead
  - $1 million reward (despite being overall leader)

**Military Commander:**
- **Hamza al-Ghamdi**
  - Former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden
  - Appointed by Hamza bin Laden
  - Has higher FBI reward than his superior ($5 million vs $1 million)
  - Organizational failure indicator

**Brothers in Leadership:**
- **Abdullah bin Laden:** Runs operations side and training camps
- **Saad bin Laden:** Deputy leader of Al-Qaeda

### Composition

**Revolutionary Aspect: Sunni AND Shia**
- Breaking traditional sectarian divide
- Never achieved at this scale before

**Member Organizations:**
- Al-Qaeda
- ISIS (including ISIS Khorasan Province)
- Taliban
- Hamas
- Hezbollah
- Iranian IRGC elements
- Any group willing to join

### Training Numbers

**Approximate Scale:**
- **120,000 people trained under Islamic Army umbrella**
- New recruits emerge identified as "Islamic Army"
- When deployed (Syria, Somalia, Mali), fighters identify as Islamic Army
- If detained: "I'm Islamic Army" not Al-Qaeda or ISIS

**Strategic Advantage:**
- Confuses intelligence collection
- Prevents accurate attribution
- Protects safe havens
- Allows proxy operations through different groups

### Territorial Agreements

**Core Philosophy Shift:**
- Al-Qaeda gave up desire to directly control territory
- Seeks political power and influence instead

**ISIS Agreement:**
- Al-Qaeda conceded territorial control to ISIS
- ISIS can run parts of Syria and Iraq
- Al-Qaeda retains political influence
- Compromise allows focus on respective strengths

**Iran/IRGC Agreement:**
- Similar territorial/influence sharing
- Joint operations planning (October 7th)
- Resource sharing
- Intelligence cooperation

**Lebanon Operations:**
- Al-Qaeda/Hezbollah joint plot against U.S.
- Only Hezbollah will claim responsibility
- Al-Qaeda involvement hidden

**Syria Operations:**
- Al-Qaeda supported Jolani's blitz with 10,000 fighters
- Taliban provided training camps
- No public acknowledgment of Al-Qaeda/Taliban
- Media reports only HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham)

### Goals and Strategy

**Primary Objectives (from Osama bin Laden):**

1. **Push U.S. out of Middle East:**
   - Embassy attacks
   - October 7th-style operations
   - U.S. Embassy Baghdad specifically mentioned

2. **Restore the Caliphate:**
   - Syria operations
   - Mali operations
   - Full North Africa
   - Eventually Spain
   - Aspirational: India

3. **Economic Damage to West:**
   - Infrastructure targets
   - Transportation systems
   - Economic symbols

4. **Homeland Attacks:**
   - Bring war to American soil
   - Mass casualty events
   - Multiple simultaneous attacks

**Methodology:**
- Use all terrorist groups collectively
- Not just Al-Qaeda achieving goals
- Collaborative operations
- Different groups claim responsibility
- Conceals true coordination extent

### Differences from Osama bin Laden's Leadership

**Hamza bin Laden's Operational Style:**

1. **Covert Operations:**
   - Prefers complete concealment
   - No video appearances
   - No audio recordings
   - Wants "Hidden Hand"
   - Groups won't claim responsibility for his operations

2. **Speed:**
   - Father took 5 years to approve 9/11
   - Hamza approves in single meeting
   - Embassy attack plan: "Brief it, I'm good, approved"
   - **Iranian IRGC complaints: "Hamza is loose cannon, moves too fast"**
   - IRGC prefers Saif al-Adel: "More calm, cool, collected"

3. **Timeline:**
   - Osama: Patient, 1,000 years for caliphate acceptable
   - Hamza: Wants everything in his lifetime
   - Create Islamic caliphate during his life
   - Fulfill all father's goals immediately

4. **Philosophy:**
   - Primary goal: "Take it to America on U.S. soil"
   - Make Americans "feel the war zones at home"
   - Goes "full force" on homeland attacks

### Compromise and Negotiation

**Constant Negotiation:**
- Hamza negotiating to bring groups into Islamic Army
- Groups give up certain demands to join
- Finding common ground despite historical conflicts

**Historical Enemies Cooperating:**
- ISIS and Al-Qaeda (historical enemies)
- Shia and Shia groups working together
- All want same outcomes, different methods

## Training and Preparation for U.S. Attacks (2023-2024)

### Training Infrastructure

**Camp Network:**
- 30 Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan
- 7 camps: Suicide bomber training exclusively
- 23 camps: General training
- Some segregated by ethnicity (Arabs vs. non-Arabs)
- Specialized camps for different training types

**Camp Capacity:**
- Training duration depends on:
  - Number of attackers
  - Camp capacity
  - Type of training required
  - Ethnic/national groupings
  - Concurrent operations

### Training Numbers by Operation

**October 7th (Israel):**
- Originally: 500 fighters, 2 months (August-October 2022)
- Actually: 1,500 fighters, 14+ months (August 2022-October 2023)

**Syria Deployment:**
- 10,000 fighters
- Extended timeline due to volume
- Advanced urban warfare training
- Recently completed, now active

**U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- 1,000 fighters claimed by Al-Qaeda
- Adams believes actual number may be higher
- Training completed over past year+
- All deployed

**Europe Attack:**
- Separate 1,000 fighters
- Separate training
- Separate deployment
- Simultaneous or sequential with U.S.

**Total Recent Operations:**
- Approximately 13,500 trained
- Islamic Army total: ~120,000 trained overall

### Training Types for U.S. Homeland Attack

**1. Advanced Urban Warfare**
- Extended training program
- Tactics seen in Taliban training videos
- High proficiency level
- Team coordination
- Weapon proficiency

**2. Suicide Bombing Training**
- Separate specialized camps
- Approximately 20% of all camps
- "Invisible bomb vest" technology
- Defeats magnetometers and K-9 detection

**3. Cover and Covert Operations**
- Don't mention Afghanistan
- Don't mention Al-Qaeda
- Use fake names even in training
- "If we're in camp together I don't know your name is Shawn Ryan"
- Extensive operational security
- Terrorists don't know each other's real names

**Training Video Evidence:**
- Taliban posted professional-level training video
- Shawn Ryan: "That scared the shit out of me"
- Note: That was Taliban - can't get Al-Qaeda video (phones banned)
- Al-Qaeda training considered even higher level

**Key Point:**
- "Their life is they train all the time"
- "If that's all you're doing all day long you're going to get really competent"
- "Different emotions behind it too, different beliefs, religion makes you more devout"

### The "Invisible Bomb" Vest

**Development Timeline:**
- Highlighted December 2023

**Developer:**
- Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula (Yemen branch)

**Capabilities:**
- Passes through standard airport magnetometers
- Components not detectable by trained explosive-sniffing dogs
- Worn concealed under clothing
- Terrorist can enter secure facilities undetected

**Technology:**
- Video demonstration released December 2023
- Quickly removed
- **TSA ignored demonstration's implications**
- Significant advancement in suicide vest technology

**Significance:**
- Most U.S. buildings unprepared
- Standard security (metal detectors, K-9) ineffective
- No apparent U.S. government preparation
- Increases vulnerability of all soft targets

**U.S. Vulnerability:**
- "We have not had a man walk up to a building with a suicide vest on in the United States"
- "Americans don't understand this"
- "Al-Qaeda knows this"
- "New and innovative" for American context
- Can walk inside buildings now (not just outside)

### Entry into United States

**Southern Border Route (Primary for general terrorists):**
- Through Darien Gap (Panama)
- Up through South/Central America
- Across U.S. southern border
- **Fake documents:**
  - Afghan passports (easiest to get from Taliban)
  - Syrian passports
  - Turkish passports

**Challenge:**
- U.S. Border Patrol agents mostly haven't been overseas
- Can't identify fake documents or wrong nationalities
- Example: Egyptian with Syrian passport - will agent know?
- "Passport says Syrian" - passes through

**Timeline Examples:**
- Fastest seen: Afghan leaving Afghanistan to U.S. border in 3 weeks
- Depends on method and passport used

**Legal Immigration (Al-Qaeda Preference):**
- "Clean" terrorists from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan
- Apply for legitimate tourist/travel visas
- Goal: **"Embarrass system again like 9/11 attackers"**
- Can fly directly to U.S.
- Legal status means less scrutiny
- Can wait indefinitely without raising suspicion
- If get visa: Can fly day after approval

**The Refugee Pipeline:**
- "Very dangerous"
- Afghan passport historically weak
- **"Now the Afghan passport is extremely powerful"**
- Humanitarians: "We need to save these Afghans from terrorists"
- **"Afghans being brought in all over world"**
- **"And Al-Qaeda is like 'holy crap'"**

**Libya Precedent:**
- **"Our terrorists in Libya were given official Libyan passports and fake names"**
- **"Exact same thing Taliban's doing"**
- Terrorists can get passports for other countries

**Testing the System:**
- **"Some still doing border to see if they can do it and test it"**
- Purpose: **"Learn about our weaknesses"**
- Adams from detainee debriefing experience: "Pay attention to what they're trying to learn about you"
- **"They are going to find our weaknesses"**
- **"Our southern border is probably our biggest weakness right now"**

**Current Status:**
- Training completed, attackers deployed
- "Depending how they come through it could take different times"
- Many likely already in U.S.

### Operational Security

**Fake Names in Training:**
- All trainees use pseudonyms in camp
- Cannot identify others if captured
- Cannot compromise under interrogation

**Long-term Placement:**
- Prefer legal entry
- Can wait months or years
- Legal status doesn't raise alarms
- Build normal-appearing life
- Activate when ordered

**Cover Identity:**
- Tell no one about Afghanistan
- Never mention Al-Qaeda
- If Saudi or Kuwaiti, maintain civilian cover
- No discussion of camps or training

### Camp Visitor Programs - Generational Planning

**Old Problem Al-Qaeda Learned From:**
- Focused only on first generation
- Didn't train second/third generation
- When U.S. drone strikes eliminated leaders, replacements inadequate
- "Third and fourth string of external operations sucked"

**New Approach:**
- Encourage marriage
- Bring in women from fighter's home country
  - Syrian fighter? Bring Syrian women
  - Don't force marriage to Afghans
- Create "whole Jihadi family"
- Train the children
- Multi-generational commitment

**Support Structure:**
- Housing provided
- Weapons provided
- Training provided
- Financial stipend
- Marriage arrangement assistance
- Education for children in ideology
- Complete social safety net

**Terrorist Testimony:**
From documentary "Jihad Rehab":
- Former Al-Qaeda asked: "Was life easier in Afghanistan?"
- Answer: "Yes"
- Reason: Complete social safety net, everything taken care of
- Focus entirely on jihad and training

**Long-term Goal:**
- "We're never going to have that failure again where second generation can't step up"

### Recruitment Demographics

**Primary Sources:**
- Afghanistan
- Pakistan
- Syria
- Libya
- Somalia
- Central Asia (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan)
- Arab countries (Saudi, Kuwait, Jordan)
- North Africa

**Recruitment Volume:**
- "There is no lack of bodies"
- "No lack of terrorist volunteering"

**Why So Many Recruits:**

1. **Social Safety Net:**
   - Complete life support
   - Housing, food, stipend
   - Marriage assistance
   - Family support

2. **Purpose and Belonging:**
   - Religious framework
   - Brotherhood
   - Clear mission

3. **Training and Weapons:**
   - Professional military training
   - Access to weapons
   - Skills development
   - Prestige in community

4. **Ideology:**
   - Religious duty
   - Martyrdom ideology
   - Anti-Western sentiment
   - Various personal motivations

**Documentary Example:**
"Jihad Rehab" showed four Al-Qaeda in Saudi rehabilitation. Each different reason for joining - Al-Qaeda targets all motivations.

### Syria Operations Recently Completed

**Recent Deployment:**
- 10,000 fighters sent to Syria (some to Iraq)
- Julani's blitz supported by these fighters
- Taliban provided training camps
- Recently completed operations
- Media only reported HTS
- No mention of Al-Qaeda or Taliban

**Current Status:**
- Fighting continues (Kurds, others)
- May redeploy to:
  - Iraq (caliphate wave)
  - Africa: Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso (caliphate wave)
- Unlikely to come to U.S. (different wave, different training)

**Wave Organization:**
- Syria fighters are "caliphate wave"
- Trained for territorial control
- Different skill set than homeland attackers
- Doesn't make sense to mix them
- Enough bodies for all operations simultaneously

### Training vs. Current Status

**What's Already Done:**
- U.S. homeland attacker training: **Complete**
- Europe attacker training: **Complete**
- Syria deployment training: **Complete**
- October 7th training: **Complete** (attack executed)

**What's Ongoing:**
- Embassy attack operational planning
- Homeland attack positioning and preparation
- Caliphate expansion (Africa, Middle East)

**Intelligence Implications:**
- "All training info now old because they trained all homeland attackers"
- "Next week you're not going to get info of homeland attacker at terrorist camp"
- "It's already done"
- Current intelligence is about:
  - Movement and positioning
  - Operational planning
  - Target selection
  - Timing decisions
  - NOT training (finished)

---

## Afghan Passport Production and Distribution (2021-2025)

### 2021-2025: 7 Million Afghan Passports Printed in Europe

**The Scale:**
- 7 million Afghan passports printed in Europe since 2021
- Shipped to Afghanistan
- Permission granted by United States State Department
- "There's probably going to print a million more passports this year, more than a million"

**Who Controls Permission:**
- United States State Department grants permission whether to print or not

**The Problem:**
> "We all know where the passports go to: Sirajuddin [Haqqani]"

**Why Afghanistan Can't Produce:**
- "Afghanistan cannot produce its own passport booklets just like it cannot produce its own currency"

**Sirajuddin Haqqani:**
- Minister of Interior, Afghanistan
- Father of suicide bombing in Afghanistan
- Killed over 1,000 American service members
- Wanted by FBI: $10 million reward (or was - State Department unclear)
- Controls passport distribution

**Ambassador Decker's Refusal:**
- On AMU TV (Afghan news show), host Sam asked: "Is Sirajuddin Haqqani still a terrorist? Is the State Department still looking for him?"
- **She refused to answer, would not call Haqqani a wanted terrorist**

### Passports as Terrorist Travel Documents

**Sarah Adams' Observations:**
> "We're also not treating these passports as compromised which is insane right, so they don't even act like the Afghan passports are compromised even though any terrorists can travel to Afghanistan and get their name changed and their face put on one of these passports"

**What She's Seen:**
- Algerian faces on Afghan passports
- Libyan faces on Afghan passports
- Syrian faces on Afghan passports
- Any nationality can get Afghan passport with new identity

**The Process:**
- Terrorists travel to Afghanistan
- Sirajuddin Haqqani issues passport with:
  - New name
  - Their face
  - Afghan nationality (false)
  - Complete new identity

## July 2024: Saleh's Presidential Term Ends

**Timeline:**
- July 2024: Time as Acting President ends per constitution
- Returns to intelligence work
- "Spies never quit"
- Runs intelligence network operational in Afghanistan

**Legend's Assessment:**
> "I don't think there's any American intelligence official that is unfamiliar with Mr. Saleh. He was and he I believe he still is our ally"

### Afghanistan Green Trend (AGT) Intelligence Network

**Organization:**
- Intelligence network operational in Afghanistan
- NOT the GDI (Taliban intelligence)
- Under control of the resistance
- Most active and reliable intelligence network
- By far most reliable intelligence Legend has seen

**Network Scale:**
- Saleh runs extensive sources in Afghanistan
- "I don't think anyone has as much sources under his control as Mr. Saleh in that region"

**Intelligence Provided:**
- Most reliable intelligence coming from AGT
- Document-based intelligence
- On-ground reporting
- Information on Taliban, Al-Qaeda, ISIS-K operations

## Current Status and 2025 Predictions

### Third Week January 2025: Record Taliban Funding

**$105 Million Sent to Taliban That Week:**
- Highest weekly amount reported
- Regular payments range $40-105 million per week
- Sarah Adams: "I even think saying 87's low at this point"
- Additional $10 million more per month to Taliban's office in Doha, Qatar

### 2025: 1,000+ Deep Cover Operatives in United States

**The 1,000+ Number:**
- Source: President Amrullah Saleh / Afghanistan Green Trend (AGT)
- "There are over 1,000 Taliban and ISIS-K operatives in the United States"

**Critical Distinction:**
> "These 1,000 are not the individuals that were emboldened after the United States abandoned Afghanistan and withdrew. These are not the individuals in the Afghan-American community in the diaspora or those we brought in - 120,000 that were evacuated. They're not members of those communities who are now sympathetic towards the Taliban."

**Who They Are:**
> "The 1,000 or so that I mentioned these are deep cover operatives that report to Sirajuddin Haqqani and then the leadership of the Taliban and ISIS-K"

### Taliban Fighters Going Back and Forth U.S.-Afghanistan

**Legend's Intel:**
> "There are Afghan Americans from California, from Tennessee, from Florida, from New Jersey, from New York that have went back and joined the Taliban that are serving with the Taliban right now and these folks go back and forth"

**The Process:**
- Trained by U.S. Special Operations while we were there
- Some evacuated to United States by Biden Administration
- Decided to go back to Afghanistan
- Joined Taliban
- Get debriefed and rebriefed by Taliban/Haqqani
- Sent back to United States
- "Don't think that individual you see in the range is only in Afghanistan - they're going back and forth"

### 2025 Predictions: Embassy Attacks

**U.S. Embassy Plots Identified:**

**1. U.S. Embassy in Bamako, Mali:**
- Active threat identified
- Al-Qaeda operational planning ongoing
- Abu Muhammad al-Masri in Mali (Al-Qaeda's best operational planner)

**2. U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia:**
- Active threat identified
- Somalia as next caliphate target
- Biggest concern right now
- Next push of caliphate plan
- Push U.S. government out of Somalia

**Sarah Adams on Embassy Attacks:**
> "We are actually funding with these dollars we send to fight ISIS, plots against us in Africa of all places besides here in the homeland. It's insane that we're funding these incidents that are going to kill Americans."

**The Coming Blame:**
> "Think of how that's going to come back right. We have some Americans die let's say Mogadishu, we have a bombing go off in Virginia, and then when you track the money down the money came from the US government. But think of how Americans are going to handle this and that's what the terrorists want. They want you to blame your government."

### 2025 Predictions: Next Caliphate Targets

**The Caliphate Plan (Led by Hamza Bin Laden):**

**Countries Already Part:**
1. **Iran** - Already considered part (long established)
2. **Afghanistan** - First in current generation
3. **Syria** - Second (just fell November 2024)

**Next Targets (Debating Which is First):**
4. **Somalia** OR **Mali**
5. **Iraq**
6. **Burkina Faso**
7. **Libya**

**Strategy:**
- Drop countries to terrorists
- Become pieces of caliphate
- Connect over time
- Create "giant Islamic emirate"

### Warning About 1,000+ Operatives in U.S.

**Purpose:**
> "They want you to feel it in your neighborhood, at your home. They don't want you to feel safe where you live now"

**Motivation:**
> "We impacted them in Afghanistan, we impacted them in Iraq, we impacted them in Syria which is kind of the most recent open wound right, and so they want our warfighters who did that in those countries to feel it here"

## Current Status and 2025 Predictions

### Confirmed Intelligence

**Number of Attackers:**
- Al-Qaeda claims: 1,000 trained and deployed for U.S. homeland
- Adams believes actual number may be higher
- Hamas attack: 1,400-1,500 attackers (similar scale)

**Training Status:**
- All training completed
- Attackers deployed
- Training information now "old"
- Won't see new training information

**Certainty Level:**
- "Al-Qaeda says they trained and deployed a thousand"
- "I think there's more than a thousand Al-Qaeda members in United States"
- "For Homeland attack that number based on what Al-Qaeda saying"

### Attack Methodology: Mumbai Model

**Primary Template: 2008 Mumbai Attacks**

**Why This Model:**

1. **Swarming Attacks:**
   - Multiple targets simultaneously
   - Overwhelms response capabilities
   - Maximum chaos and fear

2. **Operational Flexibility:**
   - Attackers given latitude to change locations
   - Can change tactics (modus operandi)
   - Mumbai train station: Supposed to be bombing
   - Terrorists saw more people, switched to shooting
   - Real-time decision making

3. **Real-Time Intelligence:**
   - Command center feeding information
   - What's on news
   - What police doing
   - Attackers adjust accordingly
   - Makes attack last longer
   - Mumbai: Extended over multiple days

4. **Extended Duration:**
   - Not hit-and-run
   - Sustained engagement
   - Maximum casualties over time
   - Maximum media coverage
   - Maximum terror impact

**October 7th Connection:**
- Also based on Mumbai model
- Same template being used
- Proven effective

### Fedayeen Fighters (Critical Concept)

**Definition:**
- Fighters who fight to death
- Not exactly suicide bombers
- Will continue until they or all enemies dead

**Significance for U.S.:**
- **"We haven't had fedayeen attackers"** in United States
- Americans don't understand this concept
- U.S. first responders not trained

**Combat Characteristics:**
- Fight for multiple days if necessary
- Will not surrender
- Apparent surrender may be deception
- May still have suicide vest
- Will detonate if guards lowered
- Requires different response tactics

**Training Level:**
- "Remember their life is they train all the time"
- "You're going to get really competent in it"

**Secondary Attacks:**
Example from Kabul:
1. First bomber detonates
2. First responders move in
3. Second bomber walks in and detonates
4. Americans don't understand this is standard

**Tactical Problem:**
- Battle ongoing
- Attacker appears to surrender
- Might have suicide vest
- First responders let guard down
- **"That man came to die"**
- Will fight until death or detonation
- **"We can't let our guards down"**
- Second and third order casualties

### Mixed Force Composition

**Not Just Al-Qaeda:**
- 1,000 total attackers
- Mix of Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters
- ISIS deliberately included
- Purpose: ISIS will claim responsibility

**Theory on Breakdown:**
- More fighter types: ISIS
  - If caught: "I'm ISIS"
  - Directs attention away from Al-Qaeda
- More suicide bombers: Al-Qaeda
  - Cannot be interrogated after detonation
  - Protects organizational security

**Attribution Strategy:**
- Attack will be blamed on ISIS
- U.S. intelligence will support ISIS attribution
- Taliban feeding U.S. intel on ISIS attackers for years
- After attack: U.S. will search databases
- Will find: "Yeah we had pieces on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers already in system as ISIS
- **"That's how well they've planned this"**

### Target Selection

**Al-Qaeda Preferences:**

1. **Symbolic Targets:**
   - U.S. Capitol (specifically mentioned)
     - In Al-Qaeda propaganda since 9/11
     - In memorials of 9/11
     - High symbolic value
   - National monuments
   - Government buildings

2. **Economic Targets:**
   - Bridges (specifically mentioned)
   - Public transportation (metro systems)
   - Infrastructure causing economic damage
   - Transportation hubs

3. **Mass Casualty Locations:**
   - Places causing fear
   - Economic impact sites

**ISIS Preferences:**
- "Just wants mass casualty"
- Softer targets
- Wherever most people are
- Opportunity-driven

**Tactical Flexibility:**
Example scenario:
- ISIS terrorist assigned to DC Metro
- Goes down, sees only 20 people
- Sees event above ground with hundreds
- Changes target to event
- Authorized for real-time decision

**Soft Targets (Shawn Ryan's Assessment):**
- Universities
- Churches
- Stadiums
- Farmers markets
- Schools
- Shopping centers
- Any high-density civilian location

### Coordination and Timing

**"Coordinated" Attacks:**
Unclear exact meaning:
- All same time?
- Monday through Friday (five straight days)?
- U.S. and Europe simultaneously?
- Different cities in U.S. at same time?

**Multiple Interpretation Scenarios:**

1. **U.S. Only:**
   - Multiple cities
   - Same time or sequential days
   - Sustained operation

2. **U.S. and Europe:**
   - Simultaneous attacks both continents
   - Same day/time
   - Maximum global impact

3. **Sequential Waves:**
   - Day 1: City A
   - Day 2: City B
   - Day 3: City C
   - Sustained terror over week

**What's Known:**
- Attacks will be "coordinated"
- Exact definition unclear
- Could mean any of above
- All involve multiple simultaneous locations

### Scale Comparison

**October 7th (Israel):**
- 1,400-1,500 attackers
- Single concentrated area
- Massive casualties and destruction

**U.S. Homeland Attack:**
- 1,000+ attackers claimed
- Multiple cities
- Potentially much larger geographic area
- Extended duration planned

**Europe Attack:**
- Separate 1,000 attackers
- Separate training
- Separate deployment
- Simultaneous or sequential with U.S.

**Casualty Estimates:**
- Scott Mann reportedly told Shawn Ryan: Al-Qaeda predicting 50,000-60,000 American deaths
- Adams didn't confirm specific number but confirmed scale of planning

### Wave-Based Attack Planning

**Wave 1: Israel/Hamas Attacks**
- Executed October 7, 2023
- Part of larger strategy to push U.S. from Middle East

**Wave 2: Embassy Attacks**
Three categories:

1. **Middle East Embassies**
   - Purpose: Push U.S. out for caliphate expansion
   - Specific: U.S. Embassy Baghdad

2. **African Embassies**
   - Purpose: Push U.S. out for caliphate expansion
   - Specific: Bamako, Mali and others

3. **European Embassies**
   - Purpose: Target U.S. for Middle East involvement
   - Coordinate with broader European attacks

**Wave 3: European Attacks**
- October 7th-style coordinated attacks
- 1,000 trained terrorists deployed
- Both embassy and mass casualty attacks
- Timing: Coordinated with U.S. homeland

**Wave 4: U.S. Homeland Attacks**
- 1,000+ trained terrorists deployed
- October 7th/Mumbai-style swarming
- Multiple cities simultaneously

**Wave 5: Caliphate Expansion**
- Syria: 10,000 fighters deployed (recently completed)
- Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso: Ongoing
- Iraq: Continued operations

### Timeline Predictions

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or Homeland attack or both"

**Caveat:**
- Israel attack planned for 2022, executed 2023 (pushed one year)
- If U.S. attack doesn't happen 2025, doesn't mean intelligence wrong
- Could be delayed
- Risk: People let guard down if doesn't happen on expected timeline

### Intelligence Pre-Planting

**The Setup:**
- Taliban feeding information to U.S. for years
- Small pieces on individual ISIS-K terrorists
- Entering U.S. intelligence databases
- Creating paper trail

**After Attack:**
- U.S. will search databases
- Will find prior intelligence on attackers
- "Yeah we had piece on this attacker, he's ISIS"
- Multiple attackers have similar entries
- All pointing to ISIS

**Result:**
- U.S. intelligence confirms "It's ISIS attack"
- Won't recognize Al-Qaeda
- Won't recognize Taliban involvement
- Won't recognize state actors (Russia, Iran, China)
- Attribution completely wrong
- Supported by years of planted intelligence

**Adams: "That's how well they've planned this"**

### What Makes This Different

**Innovations:**
1. Invisible bomb vests defeating security
2. Fedayeen fighters (new to U.S. context)
3. Real-time intelligence and flexibility
4. Swarming multiple locations
5. Extended duration engagements
6. Mix of tactics (bombing, shooting, holding positions)

**Sophistication:**
- State-level support (Iran, Russia, China)
- Multi-year planning
- Extensive training
- Operational security
- Strategic deception (ISIS attribution)
- Pre-planted intelligence in databases

**Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
- No preparation by federal government
- State/local law enforcement uninformed
- First responders untrained for these tactics
- Public completely unaware
- Open borders allowing entry
- Visa system allowing legal entry

### Warning Signs Being Ignored

**Information Flow:**
- People passed info about Hamas training in Afghanistan to Israel
- Israel ignored it
- Israel knew "Hamas planning some big plot" in Afghanistan
- October 7th happened

**Current Situation:**
- Same types of reports being passed to U.S. government
- About Al-Qaeda training for U.S. attacks
- U.S. not taking seriously
- Same pattern as Israel

**Adams' Warning:**
- "I worry because same things being passed to our government"
- "They're not taking it serious"
- "I don't know how what happened in Israel doesn't make you think twice"
- "We're making the same mistake"

**Foreign Intelligence Confirmation:**
- European intelligence contacted Adams
- Message: "Your report is spot-on. That's what we have."
- Foreign governments have same intelligence
- Question: Does U.S. have it and not preparing America?

### Al-Qaeda Power Comparison

**More Powerful Now Than Pre-9/11:**
- Definitely yes

**Pre-9/11 Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan:**
- "Had little pockets of training"
- Tarnak Farms (Kandahar)
- Sarobi camp (outside Kabul)
- "Little pockets in Afghanistan"

**Current Afghanistan:**
- **"Training center in every province being built"**
- **"The level isn't even... the al-Qaeda coming is so much bigger than al-Qaeda on 9/11"**
- **"They're already probably bigger than 9/11"**

**Progress Assessment:**
- "We have no progress on al-Qaeda at this point"
- Geopolitical: "Russia-Ukraine, major beef China-Taiwan"
- **"Now we have ISIS, al-Qaeda massing incredible amounts of people"**
- **"We're Enemy Number One"**

**Adams' Prediction:**
- **"Al-Qaeda will be the biggest it's ever been in next year. I have no doubts."**

**Current vs. ISIS:**
- ISIS (all locations): ~20,000 members
- Al-Qaeda (30 camps): 100,000 new trained recruits by end of year
- Taliban (last 2 years): 170,000 new military recruits

### Why No Action Against Known Terrorists

**Question: Why not going after these guys?**

**Adams' Answer:**
- **"Because they want you to believe al-Qaeda does not exist in Afghanistan"**
- **"So how can you kill al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan?"**

**The Strategy:**
- **"Why? Because they want us to forget about Afghanistan and move on"**

**Where She's Hearing This:**
- **"I've heard this from congressmen"**
- **"They really think this is just going to go away"**
- Probability: **"100%"**

**What's Preventing It:**
- **"Only reason Afghanistan hasn't gone away is all these pesky volunteers"**
- "Like me, like Scott [Mann], whomever, still trying to save their Afghans"
- **"We've gotten in their way and they're sick of it"**
- **"They're just waiting to plow through us until it's not in press anymore"**
- "They can move on"
- "Never want it to go on two more years"
- **"We're annoying them at this point"**

### Afghanistan - The Coming Threat

**Libya Regeneration Timeline:**
- End October 2011: Gaddafi fell
- Beginning November 2011: Al-Qaeda setting up in Benghazi
- September 2012: Conducted Benghazi attacks
- 2014-2017: War (8,000 soldiers, 20,000 civilians killed)
- Power level: 2011-2014 reached sufficient strength for 3-year war

**Afghanistan Timeline:**
- August 2021: U.S. withdrawal
- November 2023 (interview): Two years since withdrawal
- **Adams' Assessment: "Al-Qaeda is a year away from that in Afghanistan"**

**Scale Comparison:**
- "Training center in every province being built"
- **"They're already probably bigger than 9/11"**
- More powerful now than pre-9/11: "Definitely yes"

**Will Surpass Al-Qaeda in Iraq:**
- "Al-Qaeda in Iraq got very powerful, that was huge resurgence"
- **"They're going to surpass that, that's their goal"**

### Africa - The Lost Continent

**Current State:**
- **"Africa has become coup country"**
- "Every country: coup, coup, coup, coup, coup, coup"
- "We're losing all access in Africa"

**Who's Taking Over:**
- "All going to China and Russia"
- "China and Russia are taking it all"
- Not even "taking it at this point" - they have it

### Information Adams Has Shared - Ignored

**A Year Ago:**
- "I did provide something really good"
- "Actually did go up to White House level"
- **"They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"**

**Why She Can't Discuss:**
- "The negatives: If don't go after info you still want to keep your people in play who can collect"
- "In hopes maybe US will finally come around"
- "Don't want to lose people who can report info"

**The Pattern:**
Adams regularly provides intelligence on terrorist locations:
- **"I really just get 'thanks for your info.' Nothing happens."**

### State-Level Response

**Florida - Governor Ron DeSantis:**

**Initial Briefing:**
- Sarah Adams and Scott Mann met with DeSantis
- Briefed on Al-Qaeda homeland attack planning
- DeSantis statement: **"I've received no threat reporting at all on terrorism from federal government"**
- Zero federal information sharing to state level

**Immediate Actions:**

**Day After Briefing:**
- Briefed every sheriff in State of Florida
- Told them: "There's a potential threat"
- Created information sharing mechanism
- Direct line between Adams' team and Governor's office

**Florida National Guard (FNG):**
- Existed before Al-Qaeda threat briefing
- DeSantis already positioning state for CT capability
- Different legal authorities than regular National Guard
- Trained as counterterrorism force
- Comparable to federal CT units
- Can respond faster than federal agencies
- Force multiplier for law enforcement

**Strategic Vision:**
- State-level capability independent of federal government
- Doesn't exist in other states
- DeSantis saw need before briefing
- Now positioned perfectly for threat

**Potential Tennessee Response:**
- Shawn Ryan (lives in Tennessee) wants similar capability
- Idea: DeSantis speak with Governor Bill Lee
- Tennessee has large Special Operations veteran community
- Same model could work
- Planning social media campaign to reach Gov. Lee

### Federal Government Failure

**Information Sharing:**
- Zero threat reporting to states (per DeSantis)
- No information to local law enforcement
- No information to first responders
- No training recommendations
- No preparation guidance

**Budget Implications:**
- Without official threat reporting:
  - Can't get budgets for training
  - Can't justify new procedures
  - Can't prepare properly
  - No catalyst for action
  - "Haven't even done this type of training in six years"

**Current Reality:**
- Most law enforcement never heard Al-Qaeda planning U.S. attack
- No special training conducted
- No budget allocated
- No preparation occurring
- **"Most of country have never heard Al-Qaeda's planning attack here"**

**Adams' Frustration:**
- "Anyone who's like yeah this is all happening behind scenes"
- "Don't worry everyone's prepared our law enforcement knows"
- **"Most of country have never heard Al-Qaeda's planning attack here"**

### Probability of Another 9/11-Scale Attack

**Replicating 9/11 Exactly:**
- "I think exactly how it's done is hard"
- "To replace Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) who planned it"
- **"I'm not going to lie, he was a genius"**

**Their Intentions:**
- **"But do they want to do something at that level? Yes"**
- **"Do I think they will do something more innovative than 9/11? Definitely"**

**Innovation Attempts:**
- "Remember they tried it with liquids on airplanes"

**The Next Attack:**
- **"I think next attack will probably be something more innovative"**
- **"I don't think it's going to be 3,000 [deaths] but I don't think it's going to matter if it's 3,000"**

**Why Casualty Count Won't Matter:**
- **"Because they want to hit here and they want to show they can do it"**
- **"They want to do something spectacular"**

**Why They Want to Hit U.S.:**
- **"Because we're their top enemy and it always will be"**
- **"It's never going to change"**
- "Remember we locked up a lot of these guys for 20 years"
- "Not in nice prison - Pul-e-Charkhi prison, really shitty prison outside Kabul"
- **"There are terrorists very, very upset and they want revenge"**

## Financial Networks and Funding Timeline

### Weekly Cash Deliveries to Kabul

**Amount:**
- Initial reports: $40 million per week
- Revised estimates: **$44-87 million per week**
- Large discrepancy in exact amount
- Source: U.S. State Department via NGOs

**Process:**
1. Money taken from plane
2. Brought to Afghanistan International Bank (making huge money from exchange)
3. Supposedly distributed to humanitarian aid

**Reality:**
- **70% siphoned off to Taliban-only causes**
- Majority to Taliban military

**Taliban Siphoning Methods:**

1. **Basic Bribes:** Doesn't account for 70%

2. **Board Membership Requirement:**
   - Every NGO collecting from fund must have Taliban representative on board
   - Complete control of money distribution

3. **NGO Infiltration:**
   - Long-standing NGOs with State Department relationships
   - Taliban "gutted them completely, put all Taliban in them"
   - State Department: "12-year relationship, good record"
   - Not being honest: "None of them work there anymore, it's all now just Taliban"

**Critical Issue - Taliban Martyr Payments:**
- **U.S. paying welfare to Taliban martyr families**
- Every Taliban member who died fighting U.S. forces
- U.S. government paying stipend to family
- American Gold Star families "aren't getting squat"

**Justification Given:**
- "One person gave answer: 'It'll stop them from joining ISIS'"
- **Adams' Response: "The Taliban guy is already dead"**

### Three Buckets of Money

**Bucket 1: Bank Reserves ($7 Billion)**

**Origin:** Government of Afghanistan reserves when it fell (held offshore in U.S.)

**Distribution:**
- $3.5 billion: Allocated to 9/11 victims
  - Adams hasn't met anyone besides lawyers who received money
  - Earning "insane interest monthly"
  - Money location and status unclear
  - "Someone needs to be on this $3.5 billion US siphoned off"

- $3.5 billion: Moved to Swiss bank account
  - Given to Taliban government
  - Overseen by only 4 people in Switzerland

**Oversight Committee:**
1. State Department officer (Adams: "Should be Treasury or Commerce, not State")
2. Swiss diplomat
3. Afghan finance department head (appropriate background)
4. Second Afghan - potential nepotism connection to **Tom West**

**Tom West Issues:**
- Special Envoy to Afghanistan
- "Lots of issues involving him"
- Taliban sympathizer
- After Kabul fall: **"We will do anything at all cost to recognize Taliban"**

**Account Status:**
- Already earned over $180 million in interest
- Mixed reports on whether Sirajuddin has taken money
- Some say payments to Uzbekistan for electricity came from this account

**Uzbekistan Context:**
- June 2021 (before fall): U.S. military told pilots "in emergency fly planes to Uzbekistan"
- All those planes still sitting in Uzbekistan
- Taliban paying debts to Uzbekistan to get planes back
- **Message: "Uzbekistan, Pakistan - don't give planes back"**

**Bucket 2: Weekly Plane Delivery ($44-87 Million)**

*See Weekly Cash Deliveries section above*

**Bucket 3: ISIS Dollars (Classified Amount)**

**Source:** Secret annexes on Doha deal never released

**Stop 2: Deputy Prime Minister**
- **Mullah Baradar**
- **Status: Designated terrorist** (delivery violates U.S. and international law)

2. Vet all new Al-Qaeda recruits (all nationalities)
3. Move new trainees in, around, between camps
4. Move Al-Qaeda senior leadership
5. Harbor senior leadership in GDI houses (knows U.S. won't strike due to relationship)
6. Protect Al-Qaeda cash holdings (very large)
7. Control all border movements for Al-Qaeda

**Stop 4: Ministry of Interior**
- **Sirajuddin Haqqani**

**Stop 7: Al-Qaeda Military Commission**
- **Saif al-Adel**
- Runs Al-Qaeda military commission
- **De facto head of Al-Qaeda external operations** (planning attacks against U.S.)
- U.S. government lies and says he's head of Al-Qaeda
- Even if true: "Still paying weekly the head of Al-Qaeda"

**Stop 8: The Top Three of Al-Qaeda**

**The Bin Laden Brothers:**

1. **Hamza Bin Laden** - Number One
   - **Designated terrorist**
   - True leader of Al-Qaeda

2. **Saad Bin Laden** - Number Two
   - Deputy leader of Al-Qaeda

3. **Abdullah Bin Laden** - Number Three
   - **Not designated** - "only terrorist we legally can give money to"
   - **Adams: "Please designate Abdullah Bin Laden as terrorist"**
   - COO role - runs business operations side
   - Runs operations side and training camps

**Structure:**
- Hamza: Overall leader
- Saad: Deputy
- Abdullah: Business operations and training camps
- Saif al-Adel: Fighting operations

**All four senior leaders of Al-Qaeda receive U.S. cash deliveries**

**Summary:**
- "Every single delivery except one was building"
- "Every single one of those terrorists are sanctioned"
- "Every delivery is against U.S. law"

### Additional Funding Streams

**1. Taliban Political Office in Qatar**
- At least $10 million per month
- Funded by U.S. since 2013
- **Duration: 11+ years continuous funding**
- Separate from weekly Kabul deliveries

**2. Supreme Leader's Office Budget**
- Hibatullah Akhundzada (Taliban Supreme Leader)
- Total annual budget: $48 million
- U.S. contribution: Approximately $3 million per month
- Source: "Counterterrorism dollars"
- **U.S. covers nearly entire office budget**

- Run by: **Khalil Haqqani** (uncle of Sirajuddin)
- Official role: Head of refugees for Taliban
- Claimed purpose: Resettling Afghan refugees from Pakistan to Nangarhar
- **Actual use: Funding Al-Qaeda training camps**
- Amount: $5 million per month
- Recipient: **Abdulaziz Haqqani** delivers directly to camps
- Source: Humanitarian aid dollars
- Camps contain: Libyan fighters and other foreign nationals

### Congressional Inaction

**Petition Results:**
- 382,000+ signatures collected
- Submitted to Congress
- **Result: Zero action taken**

**Legislative Efforts:**

1. **House Bill - Congressman Burchett**
   - Bill introduced to stop Taliban funding
   - Status: Sitting in Senate with no sponsor
   - No senator picked it up

2. **Terrorist Designation Bill - Congresswoman Nancy Mace**
   - Purpose: Designate Taliban as terrorist organization
   - Status: Dead
   - Opposition: **Republican Congress members contacted Mace to oppose**
   - Result: Cannot get Congress to call Taliban terrorists

**Congressional Leadership:**

**Congressman Michael McCaul (Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee):**
- Recent incident: Public intoxication at airport
- Known issue: Insider trading allegations
- Action on Taliban funding: None
- Pattern: Brings witnesses for "five-minute sound clips"
- No follow-through or accountability
- No action following testimony of Tyler Vargas Andrews or others

### Theory Behind Continued Funding

**Sarah Adams' Assessment:**
Some in Congress may believe Haqqani Network (particularly Sirajuddin Haqqani) can be used as conduit against Russia, particularly regarding Ukraine war. This is only logical explanation for unprecedented funding levels.

**The Ruse:**
- U.S. believes playing Kandahari Taliban against Haqqani Network
- Reality: Both factions communicate daily via Telegram
- Coordinate all approvals and information sharing
- Present fake internal conflicts to U.S. officials
- U.S. wastes resources on non-existent political crisis
- Real issues ignored: terrorism, murders, women's apartheid

**Historical Context:**
- U.S. funded Taliban during Afghanistan War
- Funding continued while Taliban killed U.S. soldiers
- Same pattern continues post-withdrawal

### Chinese Investment

**$10 Billion Investment:**

**Key Fact:** **"$3 of every $10 gets allocated to Al-Qaeda" = $3 billion to Al-Qaeda**

**Distribution:**
- Al-Qaeda keeps some
- Gives some to affiliates: TTP and IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan)

**Beyond Lithium - Real Strategy:**

**China-Iran Oil Deal:**
- If U.S. war with China
- China will get oil from Iran
- **Afghanistan used as land route for Iranian oil**
- China worried U.S. will cut off oil from South America or Africa
- Land route insurance

**Bagram Air Base:**
- "One of more key strategic bases in world"
- Now where **Chinese PMCs (private military contractors) based**

### India-Taliban-Pakistan Triangle

**$10 Million Indian Payment to Mullah Yaqub:**
- Funded Bagram base
- Where Hibatullah's personal security based

**The Craziest Thing:**
**India using Taliban networks to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan**

**Operations:**
- Killing Kashmir militants all over Pakistan (Lahore, Karachi, etc.)
- Also killing Sikh militants

**18 Targeted for Assassination:**
- Adams verified all 18
- Groups: Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen
- **Not one from Hizb-ul-Mujahideen** - this is key

**The Theory - Kashmir Future War Plan:**

**Hibatullah Connection:**
- Religious teaching from **Fazal Rahman Khalil** (founded Hizb-ul-Mujahideen)
- Still close friends
- Hibatullah gives U.S. money to HuM and their madrassas

**Adams' Theory:**
- Taliban and HuM decided to work together
- Use India to eliminate Kashmir militants aligned to Pakistan
- India doesn't understand what's happening
- Kashmir militants are Pakistani nationalists, loyalists
- Can't be used in Fat War plan or future Kashmir war
- Taking out old guard of Kashmir militant leaders
- New generation fought in Afghanistan with Taliban
- **New generation more aligned to Taliban and Al-Qaeda than Pakistani military**
- "Creating whole new Kashmir landscape nobody has thought about"
- Will be ready in future when war plan moves to Kashmir

### Why U.S. Continues Funding

**Adams' Theories:**
1. **Terror sympathizing problem**
2. **Incompetence**
3. **Money laundering** - "People make money off it, is incentive"
4. **Politics** - "People care about politics more than country"
5. **No accountability** - "No one will be honest and say this wrong, fix it"
6. **Partisanship** - "My party doing it, that's better than someone else"

**Adams:**
- "We're in very divided country but both parties doing this"
- "They're benefiting by dividing us"
- "We participate every time we allude to it or die on hill for one of these losers"

### Irony and Propaganda Use

**Al-Qaeda's Messaging:**
- Makes jokes about U.S. funding going to camps training homeland attackers
- Insider joke: "America funding its own attack"
- Propaganda angle: Will portray as "inside job" by U.S. government
- Goal: Make Americans distrust their government
- Plays into conspiracy theories

**Building Seven Reference:**
- Al-Qaeda found 9/11 conspiracy theories "fascinating"
- Actively studies American conspiracy communities
- Plans to incorporate conspiracy theory elements into attacks
- Goal: Make conspiracy theorists view Al-Qaeda as "revolutionaries and rebels"
- Similar to Hamas supporter dynamics

# Shawn Ryan Show Episode 81.2 - Sarah Adams Interview
## Air Date: November 2, 2023

## Executive Summary

This episode features Sarah Adams, a former CIA officer who served in Libya during and after the September 11, 2012 Benghazi attacks. The interview provides an extensive analysis of the Benghazi attacks, revealing that it was a sophisticated al-Qaeda kidnapping operation directed by al-Qaeda leadership, involving approximately 150 terrorists with the goal of capturing Ambassador Stevens for prisoner exchanges. Adams exposes significant failures in the US response, including deliberate misinformation by CIA Chief of Base "Bob," the false narrative about an anti-Islamic video created by Jake Sullivan, and the Obama administration's decision to downplay the attacks while resources were misallocated to Tripoli. The interview details how key attackers remain at large, many in Afghanistan, and reveals that al-Qaeda has reconstituted to levels potentially exceeding pre-9/11 strength. Adams discusses her transition from CIA to the House Select Committee on Benghazi under Trey Gowdy, her discovery that the CIA was not actively pursuing Benghazi attackers, and her subsequent independent investigation. The interview concludes with warnings about current terrorism threats, Afghanistan as a terrorist safe haven, and concerns about terrorist infiltration through the southern US border and refugee pipelines.

## The Benghazi Attacks - Detailed Analysis

### Attack Planning and Al-Qaeda Leadership Structure

#### Supreme Command Level
**Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri** (Head of al-Qaeda)
- Directly orchestrated the operation
- Handed off execution to North Africa group (AQIM - al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb)
- Personal motivation: Two of his last deputies were killed in US drone strikes in Pakistan
  - Abu Yahya al-Libi (most recent deputy)
  - Both deputies died within one year in Pakistan
  - Second drone strike occurred June 2011
- After second drone strike: "Enough's enough, we're going to take it to the Americans in Libya"

#### Operational Command
**AQIM Leadership Chain:**
1. **Droukdel** (AQIM leader) - Received orders from al-Zawahiri
2. Passed execution to **Mokhtar Belmokhtar** (MBM) - Kidnapping operations expert designated as Mastermind
3. Both were very close to al-Zawahiri, who emphasized importance of operation

**Additional Al-Qaeda Support:**
- **AQAP (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula)**:
  - Helped fund the operation
  - Issued the fatwa making the Benghazi attack legally permissible under their interpretation
- **Egypt-based operatives**:
  - Al-Zawahiri reached out to multiple people in Egypt for support
  - One operative had just been released from prison with al-Zawahiri's brother
  - Was negotiating to set up al-Qaeda in Egypt at the time
  - Al-Zawahiri designated Benghazi as his first operation

#### Ground Commander
**Omar al-Shalali** (Adel's brother)
- Attack commander on the ground
- AQIM's head for Libya in 2012
- Brother of Adel al-Shalali (Libyan on death row in Iraq, very close friend of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi)

### Attack Objectives and Motivation

**Primary Objective**: Kidnapping operation targeting Ambassador Stevens
- **NOT** a killing operation
- Goal: Use Ambassador for prison swaps to release terrorists

**Specific Context:**
- Operation planned to honor Libyans killed in US drone strikes in Pakistan
- 2011: Many terrorists were released from prisons, creating momentum by 2012 to continue securing releases
- Three weeks before Benghazi attacks: Al-Qaeda in Benghazi kidnapped the only Quds Force officer in Benghazi
  - Demanded five al-Qaeda in Iraq detainees held in Iraq
  - Set precedent for kidnapping-for-prisoner-exchange strategy

**Target Prisoners for Exchange:**
1. **Adel al-Shalali** (Primary target - Libyan on death row in Iraq)
   - Very close friend of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
   - After Zarqawi's death, returned to Iraq as terrorist
   - Planned to carry out post-death attack honoring Zarqawi
   - Was captured and jailed
   - His capture was particularly upsetting to al-Qaeda
2. **The Blind Sheikh** (Omar Abdel-Rahman)
3. **Abu Faraj al-Libi** (Held at Guantanamo)
4. **Aafia Siddiqui** (believed to be in Texas)

### Attack Force Composition and Scale

**Total Force**: 150 terrorists dedicated to Ambassador kidnapping operation

**Force Distribution:**
- **75 terrorists**: Assaulted the compound directly
- **75 terrorists**: Cordoned off surrounding streets

**Fighter Quality:**
- **Minimum 50 confirmed al-Qaeda members**
- Remaining fighters were al-Qaeda affiliates
- Adams notes: "I'm not even sure I can name an attack with 50 al-Qaeda terrorists at the attack"
- Scale assessment: "I don't even know if I can name any terrorist attack with extra 150 terrorists"

**Combat Experience of Attackers:**
Adams emphasizes these were not "bottom of the barrel minions" but highly trained operatives. The interview documents extensive combat histories:

1. **Afghanistan Mujahideen Era**
   - Multiple attackers fought during Soviet-Afghan War

2. **Algerian Civil War** (often forgotten)
   - 200,000 civilians killed in this conflict
   - MBM (Mokhtar Belmokhtar):
     - Initially fought in Afghanistan
     - When Algerian Civil War kicked off, "jumped ship" and went there
     - Gained most of his credentials in this conflict
   - "Insane jihad thing that always gets ignored"

3. **Iraq Wars** (2003-2004 onward)
   - Multiple attackers had Iraq combat experience

4. **Libyan Revolution**
   - Most recent combat experience before Benghazi

5. **Post-Benghazi**: Syria
   - Attackers went to Syria after the Benghazi operations

**Leadership Relationships:**
- "Pretty much every senior leader al-Zawahiri reached out to either him or bin Laden or Zarqawi had a long time established relationship with"
- Only exception: One senior leader had no prior experience
  - MBM took over a random village in Algeria
  - Recruited a fluent English-speaking businessman to be a terrorist during city takeover
  - Made him commander of his AQIM cell specifically because he spoke English
  - Role: Communicate with Ambassador during captivity
  - Two Canadians also recruited to serve as English speakers for managing the Ambassador in shifts

**Al-Qaeda Cell Structure:**
- AQIM had multiple cells (Adams notes complexity: "I don't want to get complicated with that")

### Attack Timeline and Events

#### September 11, 2012

**9:42 PM**: Attack begins on the diplomatic compound

**9:48 PM**: CIA receives immediate call from compound
- GRS (Global Response Staff) team visible on cameras sitting in cars, ready to depart
- Waiting for orders to respond

**Timeline of Compound Fire:**
- **Approximately 10:00 PM**: Fire started at guard shack inside consulate (early fire)
- **Approximately 10:10 PM**: Terrorists reach Ambassador's villa location
  - Cannot initially gain entry
  - Begin setting fire to Ambassador's villa at this time

**CIA Response Delay:**
- **10:05 PM**: CIA team finally departs (23 minutes after attack began)
- **10:07 PM**: CIA team arrives at compound (2-3 minute trip)

**Critical Analysis of Timing:**
- GRS was ready to leave at 9:48 PM
- Fire on Ambassador's villa started around 10:10 PM
- If GRS had departed when ready: "Mathematically they would have been there before the fire started - they wouldn't even have to put out a fire"
- The 17-minute delay (9:48 to 10:05) was the difference between prevention and response

**Result of Delay**: First two deaths
- Ambassador Stevens
- Sean Smith (State Department Information Management Officer)

#### Early Morning September 12, 2012

**Approximately 1:30 AM**: Team Tripoli arrives at Benghazi airport

**1:30 AM - 5:00 AM**: Team Tripoli held at airport
- Held by commander working (unknowingly) for Wasam bin Hamid
- Commander received call from Wasam: "Let them go"
- CIA officer overheard this conversation in real time: "Wasam bin Hamid said we can go now"

**5:05 AM**: Team Tripoli arrives at CIA Annex
- Commander who escorted them enters building with the skiff
- Inside building: Bob (Chief of Base), CIA personnel, GRS team lead

**5:05 AM**: Wasam bin Hamid calls the commander's fighters
- Orders them to abandon the building immediately
- Fighters protest: "I can't leave my commander inside"
- Wasam: "I don't care about your commander, leave"
- Forces abandon the building

**5:17 AM**: First mortar hits CIA Annex (12 minutes after Team Tripoli arrival)

**Deaths from Mortar Attack:**
- Tyrone Woods
- Glen Doherty

### The "Bob" Factor - CIA Chief of Base Failures

**Bob's Background:**
- Started in CIA as a medic (not case officer)
- Later rotated into case officer role
- Spent entire career at "the farm" (CIA training facility)
- Limited war zone experience:
  - First war zone: Eastern Afghanistan
    - Got his asset killed
    - Attempted money payoff cover-up
    - Got in trouble and sent home
  - Second war zone: Benghazi (only other deployment)
- Contrary to claims of "long storied career as case officer"

**Bob's Operational Failures:**

1. **Misunderstanding of QRF (Quick Reaction Force) Doctrine:**
   - CIA stations normally have GRS as QRF
   - Bob "did not believe in our QRF or believe we had a QRF"
   - "Viewed 17th February Brigade as his QRF in a weird way"
   - Only wanted 17th February to respond, never wanted his own people to respond

2. **Critical Phone Call - First Contact:**
   - Bob called Fawzi Bukatef (head of 17th February Brigade)
   - Response: "I'm not sending you any help. I don't have any help to send you. I'm not sending you any help tonight."
   - 17th February Brigade had sent approximately 25 terrorists to participate in the attacks (unbeknownst to Bob at the time)
   - Brigade commander wouldn't send people to attack his own terrorists

3. **The Lie That Killed:**
   - After being told 17th February wouldn't help, Bob lied to his GRS team
   - Told them: "We're waiting on 17th February to respond"
   - Claimed he spent time "begging them" but knew they weren't responding from first phone call
   - "17th February never responded with even one body to the Benghazi attacks"

4. **What Broke the Impasse:**
   - GRS team only left when State Department officer said: "If you don't come now we're going to die"
   - Team said "screw it" and abandoned the "coob" (CIA Operations Base)
   - Bob "could have held them there all night because he could have kept lying that 17th February was doing a response"

**Repercussions for Bob:**
- **None - Instead received rewards:**
  - Given "the most senior award in the CIA"
  - Benghazi was supposed to be his last trip before retirement
  - Because of accolades, was sent back to the farm as trainer
  - Last known position: Trainer at the farm
- Adams quotes the saying: "Fuck up, move up"

**Congressional Investigation Note:**
- Congress asked Bob about his actions
- Never held accountable for decisions that led to deaths

### Three Militias Warning - Ignored Red Flags

**Two Days Before Attack:**
Three most powerful militias in Benghazi withdrew security support:

1. **17th February Brigade**
   - US was paying them to protect the consulate
   - Explicitly stated: "We're not going to protect you and moves anymore"
   - This is why Boon and others extended their stay to provide security for Ambassador

2. **Rafallah al-Sahati**
   - Commander of Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi (al-Qaeda branch)
   - Senior leader in the terrorist network

3. **Third militia** (name not specified in transcript)

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Ambassador Stevens' trip should have been canceled
- All three most powerful militias saying "we're not helping you with security anymore" = clear threat indicator
- Adams: "Something's happening... they should have canceled his trip because it's weird the biggest militias don't want to do security anymore"
- "Nobody pieced it together"

---

## Military and Government Response Failures

### Resources That Could Have Responded

Adams states: "I'm not really sold on the Marine AR [FAST team] moved slow, the CIF was on a training mission. They didn't even think of sending fighter jets. I honestly think they were just going to drop the ball anyway."

However, she identifies resources that could have made a difference:

1. **French Special Forces**
   - Based in Libya
   - Had fighter jets within region

2. **Qataris**
   - 50 Special Forces based in Tripoli

### The CIF (Commander's In-Extremis Force) Problem

**Location**: Croatia (on training mission)

**Critical Issue**: Didn't even have their airplane with them

**Response Timeline:**
1. Finally told to deploy
2. Airplane at Aviano base in Italy had to fly to Croatia to pick them up
3. Team took 12 hours of mandatory crew rest
4. Loaded plane
5. Flew to Italy

**Adams' Assessment**: "I'm saying we can't even say the CIF is going to get there. Even if they overrode the crew rest thing, they still didn't have their own plane with them."

**Personnel Note**: Adams worked with Mike Glover at GRS. Glover was believed to still be in Army at this point, possibly with the CIF. He may have been on the North Carolina team rather than the Croatia CIF.

### Department of Defense Positioning Failures

**Key Quote**: "DOD was not positioned to respond and it's sad. They're supposed to be."

**The 9/11 Date Problem:**
- September 11 is a known high-risk date
- No heightened military readiness despite date significance

**AFRICOM Command Structure Issues:**
- Supposed to be EUCOM and AFRICOM
- AFRICOM wasn't set up yet
- Only EUCOM CIF existed, covering both EUCOM and AFRICOM areas
- This single CIF was on training mission in Croatia

### Two Teams That Deployed

**Both teams flew to Italy** (not Libya, where attack was happening):

1. **CIF from Croatia**
2. **Team from North Carolina**

- Both arrived around same time (within 2 hours of each other)
- Adams: "Their plan was to all of them was to go to Italy. It's going on in real time in Libya. I'd be pissed if I was them if I landed. I'm in Italy, I'm like why am I not landing in Libya."
- Military personnel were indeed "pissed" about being sent to Italy instead of Libya

### The Tripoli Diversion - Resource Misallocation

**5:00 AM Directive** (after last attack at 5:17 AM):
- First order came out at 5:00 AM
- **Nothing deploys to Benghazi**
- **All resources directed to Tripoli**

**The Facebook Threat:**
- Unverified Facebook page posted threat against Tripoli Embassy
- Not from a page "the US was really tracking"
- "Nothing" as far as credible intelligence
- Yet all DOD attention and State Department attention shifted to Tripoli

**Adams' Assessment**:
- "That's why I said the DOD ain't your heroes in this one"
- "Nothing deploys until 5:00 in the morning. Remember the last attack is 5:17. They weren't even close to responding that night - pure failure."

### CIA Information Sharing Failure

**Critical Communication Breakdown:**

**At State Department Compound:**
- State Department personnel: Every minute updating "this is happening, this is happening, this is happening"
- Information "really well shared," everyone moving together

**After Moving to CIA Compound:**
- "No one in the CIA is sharing: 'Hey we just got attacked, we got attacked'"
- CIA "downplaying it"

**GRS Team Lead's Description:**
- Called the attack "pop shots"
- Called the first attack on the compound "pop shots"
- Severe minimization of threat level

**Consequence of Poor Communication:**
- "If they're not sharing it, guess what happens?"
- When Facebook threat emerged, decision-makers had inadequate information about Benghazi situation
- Led to resource misallocation to Tripoli

### The "Hostage Situation" Revisionism

**DOD Post-Hoc Narrative:**
- After the fact, DOD claims: "We actually thought it was a hostage situation and we had more time"
- Claimed they thought they might have "multiple days to deal with this scenario"
- "We're trying to work through it"

**Adams' Rebuttal:**
- "That's not what happened in real time"
- Post-event rationalization for failure to respond

### FAST Team Deployment Issues

**Originally Planned**: Deployment to Tripoli only

**Reason**: By approximately 1:00 AM, focus had shifted entirely to Tripoli based on Facebook threat

**Hillary Clinton's Interference:**
- Changed FAST team four times
- Issues debated: uniforms, aircraft type, diplomatic clearances

**The Reality:**
- All debates were unnecessary
- **General Housi** (head of Libyan Air Force) gave blanket authority immediately
- Quote: "Send in what you want, do what you want, you have free reign"
- Full flight clearances from beginning - no restrictions on uniforms, planes, or anything else
- "They had 100% clearance from the Libyan government to come and save our people any way they wanted"

**Adams' Assessment**: "Anybody saying 'oh no we had to work through those things and discuss those things' - that's not true. They had clearances from the beginning. She just got in the way when all those negotiations with the FAST and the uniforms."

**Historical Context**:
- Adams notes this is common in African crises
- Algeria has done similar things before: "Do what you need"

### Obama's Actions During the Attack

**What Obama Did:**
1. Told Secretary of Defense: "Use all means to do this"
2. **Got on a plane to Las Vegas to see Beyoncé and Jay-Z**

**Timeline**: Attack was ongoing when he flew to Vegas

**What He Didn't Do:**
- Did not cancel trip
- Did not stay to ensure his orders were followed up on
- Did not maintain command presence during crisis

**Adams' Observation**: "Why did he not cancel that trip and stay and make sure his orders were followed up on? That's one thing that wasn't done that surprises me that nobody ever complains about."

**Public Awareness**: "You hear that everybody?" - Adams emphasizing the significance

**Adams' Assessment of Accountability**: "The problem's way bigger than Hillary. I don't like to focus on Hillary because she's like the scapegoat and she's done a million things wrong, but God there's so many other people."

### Fighter Jets - Never Considered

**Adams' Statement**: "They didn't even think of sending fighter jets"

No fighter support was planned or considered for the ongoing attack.

## The False Narrative - The Video Lie

### Jake Sullivan's Creation

**Jake Sullivan's Current Position**: National Security Advisor (at time of interview in 2023)
- Also described as "working all these beautiful Iran deals" (sarcastic)

**The Video Background:**
- Video initially came out Spring 2011
- Translated version released August 2012
- Originally titled "Innocence of Muslims" - anti-Islamic video

**The Egypt Protest:**
- Planned protest in Egypt had nothing to do with the video
- Scheduled for August initially
- Moved to September 11
- When moved, organizers said "when we do the protest we're going to also talk about this video"
- Video "kind of got wrapped in because it was around the same time"

**Critical Context - Protest Organizers Were Benghazi Planners:**
Those organizing the Egypt protest were involved in Benghazi attacks:
1. **Al-Zawahiri's brother**
2. **Mokhtar Salem** - Famous commander
   - "Old days in Afghanistan when they took down the big Bamiyan statues, he was standing there overseeing that"
   - Direct connection to Taliban's 2001 destruction of Buddha statues

**The Connection**: "They're the ones hosting this protest in Egypt. They know there's a planned attack in Benghazi when they're hosting it."

**The Protest Reality**: Even the Egypt protest "was nothing to do with the video. It was supposed to be like 3 weeks before."

### The Narrative is Created and Spreads

**Jake Sullivan's Decision**: "Decides to use this video as a fake narrative and they run with it"

**The Problem**: "It worked"

**How It Went Viral:**
1. Administration runs with video narrative
2. It became news
3. **Video went viral September 13** (two days AFTER the attack)
4. Only went viral "because of the policy makers"
5. Libyan policy makers started repeating it
6. Created self-fulfilling prophecy

**Adams' Key Point**: "Nobody even pays attention to it's like guys, the video didn't go viral until two days after the attack, only because of the policy makers."

### Intelligence Community Failures - The NSA Report

**The Sloppiness:**
Adams calls this "one of the most famous things we bring up in the Benghazi committee report"

**What Happened:**
1. NSA wrote a report on Benghazi attacks
2. Added a comment at the top
3. **Cut and pasted the comment from the press** (not from intelligence collection)

**The Specific Error:**
- Report stated: "At 5:00 PM there were protests in Benghazi"
- **Two problems:**
  1. There was NOTHING at 5:00 PM in Benghazi
  2. The 5:00 PM timeframe was from **Cairo**, not Benghazi
- They got both the time and location wrong

**The Classification Scandal:**
- Despite being cut from press reports, this was marked **Top Secret SCI**
- Analysts started taking this comment
- Marking it as highest level classified intelligence
- Policy makers reading it: "Oh that's top secret evidence that there was a protest"
- False information was being elevated as premium intelligence

**Adams' Assessment**:
- "That piece was crappy intelligence"
- "Hopefully it wasn't more sinister"
- Implies possibility it could have been deliberate rather than incompetent

### The Evidence Against the Narrative

**What Administration Knew in Real Time:**

**Hillary Clinton:**
- Sent email to her daughter stating it was al-Qaeda
- "She knew in real time it was terrorist. We all know that."
- Had proof showing it was terrorist attack

**When Evidence Was Presented:**
- Adams and others: "We went and told them 'Hey we have evidence there was no protest'"
- Administration response: "They didn't change it"
- By then, "everybody was marching along with what the administration wanted"
- "They didn't want to push back on Jake Sullivan and Ben Rhodes and..."

### Who Pushed the False Narrative

**Primary Architects:**
1. **Jake Sullivan** - Created the video narrative
2. **Ben Rhodes** - Wrote much of the messaging
   - Wrote Susan Rice's talking points for talk shows
   - Wrote statements for Obama and Clinton

**Those Who Spread It:**
1. **Obama** - Made statement pushing video narrative
2. **Hillary Clinton** - Made statement pushing video narrative
3. **Susan Rice** - Famous talk show appearances
   - Her talking points "actually written by Ben Rhodes"

**Hillary Clinton Specifically:**
- "Apologizing for that video after the Benghazi attack instead of standing up for our men and women over there"
- "Jake made the video narrative right and then they all jumped on board"

**What She Did Wrong**: "The main thing she did wrong in that piece was pushing a narrative she knew was fake because she knew in real time it was a terrorist attack."

---

## Hillary Clinton's Broader Issues

### The Pay-to-Play Allegations

**Pre-September 11, 2012 Concerns:**

Adams: "Her issues go so much beyond that [the video narrative]. The issue that a lot of people had with Hillary, if we're going to say we're September 10th, you know what I mean, let's pretend the attack didn't happen..."

**The Core Allegation:**
- As Secretary of State, traveled country to country meeting with leaders
- **"In her case you had to donate money to her foundation to meet with her"**
- "In some places so many people were meeting with her in the pay-for-play scheme"

**The Consequences:**
- "Some of our military commanders couldn't get time with her"
- "Places she didn't even meet, some of the CIA thought she'd meet with"
- People who should have had access as part of official US government business were blocked
- Foreign donors who gave to Clinton Foundation got meetings

**Adams' Summary**: "One of the issues with Hillary was a lot of people are really upset that she kind of sold out the office of Secretary of State."

**Legal Question:**
Interviewer: "Is that legal?"
Adams: "Well, that's the complaint. That's the issue."

### The Server Issue - What Was Really On It

**Timeline of Server Discovery:**
- "Almost 2 years after she had left office for it to become clear that she had been using this private email"
- Process revealed:
  - She had handed over 30,000 emails
  - **31,000 (almost 32,000) had been deleted**
  - All being handled by private server in her home
  - "The government never possessed a complete record of her official communications while she was in office"

**Public Misconception:**
Adams: "A lot of people think that Hillary Clinton's server matters because of the Benghazi attacks. Hillary doesn't talk to al-Qaeda. What's on the server? Hillary Clinton server is all the economic and financial dealings she had in Libya of course, and then all those other things as she traveled around."

**What Was Actually On the Server:**
- Not operational details of Benghazi attack response
- Evidence of economic and financial dealings in Libya
- Records of pay-to-play arrangements globally
- "All those other things as she traveled around"

**Why People Cared:**
- "A lot of people don't actually understand that and they put the server issue with the Benghazi attacks"
- What people think: Server would contain evidence of activities related to foundation donations and access
- "That would be the evidence of the activities everyone said she did"
- Could potentially be prosecuted based on server contents

**What Happened to Evidence**: "That's what got wiped. That info."

**Current Status:**
- "It's gone"
- "There might have been people who got into it but yes it's not with any sort of agency who can prosecute her"

### Hillary's Actions Night of Attack

**What She Actually Did Wrong That Night:**
- "Most people know she made the FAST team change four times"
- All the negotiations about uniforms and aircraft were unnecessary (Libya had given blanket approval)
- "She just got in the way"

**What She Could Not Have Done:**
Adams: "I don't think Hillary could have done anything. Hillary just got in the way that night."
- Secretary of State doesn't have operational command authority
- Her interference slowed things down but she didn't have power to deploy military assets

## The Second Attack - CIA Annex (Separate from Al-Qaeda Operation)

### Wasam bin Hamid - The Opportunist Commander

**Background:**
- The CIA Annex attack was **NOT part of al-Qaeda's plan**
- **No al-Qaeda attackers went to the CIA Annex** - completely separate operation
- Wasam bin Hamid took advantage of al-Qaeda's attack to conduct his own operation

**How It Started:**
1. Wasam bin Hamid was "hanging out outside watching the attack on the consulate"
2. Received phone call from guy in Tripoli
3. Caller: "Hey I just got a call from the Americans here [referring to the two JSOC guys], they're sending a rescue force from here to Benghazi and they want you to help"
4. Wasam's reaction: "What the fuck? There's more Americans coming to Benghazi?"
5. "He kind of lost it on the phone"

**Critical Connection:**
- The Tripoli contact was someone **Jason/Jay Su had a relationship with**
- Adams: "Which probably wasn't a solid relationship as we now know"
- Wasam bin Hamid was actually called to go pick up Team Tripoli (to escort them safely)

**The Overhead Conversation:**
- Someone nearby overheard Wasam after the phone call
- Quote: **"I'm going to kill all the Americans tonight"**
- This is when he formulated the mortar attack plan

### Wasam's Mortar Attack Planning

**The Setup:**
1. Sent a commander to the airport to interdict Team Tripoli when they arrived
2. Purpose: Hold them at airport to buy time for mortar setup
3. Team Tripoli arrived approximately 1:30 AM
4. Held at airport until almost 5:00 AM

**The Release:**
- Wasam called the commander at airport: "Let them go"
- CIA officer overheard this in real time: "Wasam bin Hamid said we can go now"

**The Unwitting Commander:**
- Commander who held Team Tripoli was "completely unwitting"
- Had no idea he was being used for terrorist attack
- Escorted Team Tripoli to CIA Annex
- Went inside building where skiff was located (Bob and all CIA personnel inside)

**The Extraction:**
- Wasam bin Hamid called this commander's fighters outside
- Ordered them to leave immediately
- Fighter response: "I can't leave my commander inside"
- Wasam: "I don't care about your commander, leave"
- Forces abandoned the building
- First mortar hit immediately after

**Timing:** Team Tripoli arrived at 5:05 AM, first mortar hit at 5:17 AM

### Wasam bin Hamid's Rise and Death

**Post-Benghazi Career:**
- "Did so well in this attack he eventually became the al-Qaeda head for Benghazi"

**The Benghazi War (2014-2017):**
- Huge war in Benghazi with terrorists
- Ran from 2014 to January 2017
- Wasam took over "late 2014, early 2015"

**Terrorists Started Losing:**
- AQIM head issued "whole call out to international terrorists"
- Message: "Go to Benghazi and fight with Wasam, go save our base in Benghazi"
- **It actually worked**
- Survived another 14 months due to international terrorist reinforcements

**Death:**
- Libyan National Army with UAE support conducted mortar strike on Wasam
- Got hit, suffered for "maybe about 10 days" and died

**Al-Qaeda's Response:**
- Afraid remaining fighters would give up if they knew Wasam was dead
- **Lied about his death for "a few weeks"**
- Eventually couldn't hide it anymore
- After truth came out: **Benghazi fell and al-Qaeda lost its base there**
- **Haven't gotten it back since**

### Wasam's Two Operational Deputies - Current Targets

**Deputy #1:**
- "Longtime al-Zawahiri associate"
- Brought in bunch of al-Qaeda people to fight during Libyan Revolution

**Deputy #2: Wasam's Brother**
- Lives in **Turkey**
- **Multimillionaire**
- **Terrorist financier** for both al-Qaeda and ISIS
- Huge funder of both organizations

**The 2018 Visa Scandal:**

Timeline:
1. **2018**: Wasam's brother applied for US visa
2. **Visa was granted** despite his profile stating he joined ISIS in 2015
3. He was known to be both al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliated
4. Went to airport to fly to America
5. **Turkish authorities stopped him** - he must have been on some sort of Turkish list
6. Turks didn't let him fly to America

**Adams' Reaction**: "Are you serious?"

**Timeline Emphasis**: "This wasn't some long super time ago. 2018."

**Adams' Assessment**: "It's super frustrating working Benghazi as you can imagine because people don't care and stuff like this happens and he almost got to the United States."

### The Hamas Connection

**When Wasam bin Hamid Died:**
- Multiple people called his family to express condolences
- **Head of Hamas called**
- **Abdullah Azzam's son called**
  - Abdullah Azzam is "kind of like the Godfather of al-Qaeda"
  - Son called Wasam bin Hamid's family: "Sorry for your loss"

**Adams' Analysis**: "These things are so much bigger than we just talk about an attack on the Consulate in Benghazi and people are so lost that it is this big thing and it's all connected. They want to ignore that and they want to make Benghazi this little thing on the side that randomly happened when it's a piece of the whole pie. They want to compartmentalize everything."

### CIA Annex Attack Complexity

**Research Challenge:**
Adams notes this attack "is a lot of work just FYI if you're trying to track these people down"

**Current Investigation:**
- Adams and her team are focused on identifying the mortar team
- **10-man mortar team** that hit the CIA Annex
- Recently named one member
- **Nine more to go**
- This is their "near-term focus"

## Sarah Adams' Journey to the Benghazi Committee

### Initial Recruitment (2015)

**How It Happened:**
- 2015: Recruited from CIA by Trey Gowdy
- Position: Executive appointment on Select Committee on Benghazi
- Initial contact: "Some of the guys from Benghazi gave Trey my phone number and he called me"

**First Conversation with Trey Gowdy:**
- Asked basics: "How things worked in Benghazi, the different terrorists, atmospherics"
- Things Gowdy "didn't know or understand"
- Gowdy liked what she had to say
- Offered: "How about you join my committee?"

**Adams' Initial Response**: "Hell no"

**Why She Refused:**
- "Didn't pay much attention to Congress like most humans"
- Another Benghazi report had just come out
- Report was from committee run by **Mike Rogers**
- Adams had read it: "It was horrible. I actually had read it and commented all over it"
- Thought it was Gowdy's report
- When she said "hell no," Boon corrected her: "You said that to a congressman? That's super rude. I think that was someone else."
- Adams: "My bad"

**Boon's Advice:**
- "If he comes around again, maybe have a discussion"
- "At least sit down and see what they're working on, see if they're doing anything you're interested in"
- Adams agreed: "If it comes around again"

### Afghanistan Consideration

**At Same Time:**
- Adams was considering proposing to CIA: Let her work on red team in Afghanistan
- Believed **Mullah Omar was in Afghanistan** at the time
- Working on proposal to pitch going to Afghanistan for a year

### Second Contact and Meeting

**Gowdy Called Back:**
- Asked: "Will you come up and just sit with my staff?"
- Adams: "Fine, I'll come sit with your staff"

**The DC Visit:**
- Flew to DC
- "Thought it was in the basement, apparently it's not. There's multiple basements in the Capitol, who knew"
- Found the office
- Conference room meeting with Gowdy's staff

**The Meeting:**
- Staff director "sleeping during the meeting"
- Got done with meeting
- Trey Gowdy called

**Post-Meeting Conversation:**
- Gowdy: "What did you think?"
- Adams: "I just don't think this is for me"
- Gowdy: **"I'll let you live in Tampa"** (where Adams wanted to stay in Florida)
- Adams: "Okay, now we're speaking"

**The Negotiation:**
- "Had a little negotiation and a little discussion"
- Adams decided to join committee
- "Basically transferred from CIA in the government process over to the Benghazi committee"

### The Democrat Opposition Campaign

**Trey Gowdy's Vision:**
- Wanted Republicans and Democrats "to sit together and work together"
- "Never even asked my political party"
- Adams wasn't political anyway
- **On paper she was registered Democrat**

**Democrats Discovered This:**
- Realized Trey hired a Democrat
- **"Came at me like there's no tomorrow"**

**Their Theory:**
- Adams knew "covert action stuff that didn't exist"
- Trey hired her to **cover it up** so it wouldn't come out
- Specifically: **Benghazi Annex was moving weapons to Syria**

**Adams' Response to Weapons Theory:**
- "Guys, if we're going to move weapons to Syria we don't need to ship them through some crappy little State Department and CIA Annex in Benghazi to get them all the way to Syria"
- "We would just take them to Turkey and bring them in"

**The Stinger Confusion:**
Many people confused weapons in Libya:

**The Facts:**
- **Stingers**: US-made MANPADs given to Afghan mujahideen
- **Zero Stingers in all of Libya**
- What Libya had: **Russian SA-7s, SA-9s**
  - Also MANPADs
  - Came out of Gaddafi stockpiles
  - Proliferated everywhere after Gaddafi fell

**The Misconception:**
- People think MANPADs in Libya are there because "US brought them in like Stingers"
- Reality: "Those are Gaddafi's MANPADs and now we're just trying to get rid of them so terrorists don't get them"

**Root of Confusion:**
- People think of "Charlie Wilson's War"
- Assume US did same thing in Libya
- Reality: "The Libyan Revolution we were air support. We dropped stuff from planes. That's how we helped them win."
- "Nothing like the Soviet War"

### The Democrat Obstruction

**First Action - Blocked From Working:**
- Democrats "barred me from doing anything"
- Couldn't even access systems
- **First two months: Could do no work**
- "I don't even think I could get in the email"

**Second Action - CIA Removal Attempt:**
- Democrats went to CIA to have CIA remove Adams from committee
- Adams had to go to CIA with CIA lawyer

**CIA Lawyers' Response:**
- To Democrats: "It's odd she's on the committee, but she's the adviser"
- "It's completely logical that he would hire someone who worked in Benghazi as his adviser on Benghazi"
- CIA position: **"We see no conflict"**
- CIA said she can stay

**Third Action - Threatened Report Release:**
- Democrats planned to release report about Adams
- Would discuss "some of my time in Africa that was an issue"
- Adams notes she has no confirmed idea what it was about: "Maybe it was made up"

**The Protection:**
- Republican lawyers: "You can't just release stuff on the CIA without getting CIA to approve it"
- "If you want to put something out on Sarah, send it to CIA for review and you can put it out"
- Democrats backed away after this

**Elijah Cummings' Intervention:**
- Elijah Cummings (Democratic leader of committee)
- Got involved, asked his staff: "What is this?"
- Told them: **"This is foolish"**
- Stepped in and stopped the attacks
- Adams: "I wouldn't call Elijah Cummings an issue, it was like the people under him"

### The Abu Anas al-Libi Controversy

**Background on Abu Anas al-Libi:**
- Mastermind of Kenya and Tanzania Embassy bombings
- Main target in Tripoli (in addition to MBM)
- Had been detained in Iran for years
- Released because he was about to die
- Adams: "You should have seen this guy. He couldn't even carry stuff. His brother took care of his family."
- "On death's doorstep"

**Adams' Trip to Libya (Spring 2012):**
- Went to CIA before leaving
- COSOS (Chief of Station Overseas) wanted her to do capture operations
- CIA: "There's no legal approvals for capture operations. We're not going to give you any approvals. You're not going to capture anyone."

**Situation Changed:**
- Adams went out, "put it all in motion"
- Got drones, got approvals
- CIA: "Holy crap"
- Circled back: "Now that you have the whole infrastructure, go capture Abu Anas"

**Adams Refused:**
- Reason: "He's going to die in our custody"
- To COSOS: "I can't capture him. He's going to 100% die in our custody."
- "We were going to use militias. Intelligence service was just set up."
- Prediction: "If we capture him he will die before he goes to a courtroom. I promise you."

**COSOS Response:**
- Chief of Station backed Adams
- Both refused to do the capture

**What Happened After They Left:**
- After Adams and COSOS both left Libya
- Others did the capture
- **Abu Anas died in custody before going to court**

**The Medical Intervention:**
- While in custody, they tried keeping him alive
- **Gave him a liver transplant**
- Adams: "That could have gone to an American"
- "Basically another American died for him"
- "Really messy"

**Adams' Vindication**: "They never should have touched him. He was on death's doorstep."

**Congressional Reaction:**
- "A lot of people had issues with the fact that I refused to capture him"
- Part of Democrats' justification for their obstruction campaign

### Finally Allowed to Work

**The Resolution:**
- Adams agreed to sit down one-on-one with Democrats
- They asked "a trillion questions"
- Finally let her work

**Timeline:**
- First two months: No work
- Third month: Finally working
- Could now go over to CIA "to do real work"

### The Elevator Moment - The Discovery

**Setting**: Month three, Adams finally working and visiting CIA

**The Encounter:**
- Adams in elevator with other people from Benghazi committee
- Analyst she knew stepped on elevator
- Adams knew he was "in the shop that should be working Benghazi"
- "He was good. One of the best analysts I knew in the agency."

**The Conversation:**
Analyst: "What are you working on now?"
Adams: "The Benghazi committee"
Analyst: **"I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole"**

**Adams' Realization:**
- "This guy was the best, got great integrity, hard worker"
- "In the shop that would be working Benghazi"
- "Won't touch it, they're not doing it"

**The Phone Call:**
- When Adams left CIA that day, called Boon
- **"The CIA is not going after the Benghazi attack"**
- Boon: "What are you talking about? It's been a few years. They must be."
- Adams: **"No. That's why we haven't seen anything. They're not going after them."**
- **"That's the day we decided to do our own investigation and track them down ourselves"**

**Adams' Assessment of Committee Value:**
- "I would do the Benghazi committee again only for the fact it was the only way I realized CIA wasn't working on the Benghazi attackers"
- "100% it was worth that one minute in the elevator"
- Otherwise: "Not really, it was just a waste of time"

### Reflections on Congressional Service

**What She Learned:**
- "Congress doesn't have a lot of teeth"
- "I don't know what teeth they have now that they're locking people up"
- "At least when I was there, they put all these committees together, they write great reports"
- "Our report is excellent"

**The Problem:**
- "But what's it do?"
- "They don't have, they don't use the carrots and sticks they need"
- "Congress holds all the money but they never actually go make the threats or force people to make the change"

**Future Commissions:**
- "They're going to make this big Afghanistan War commission"
- "Is there teeth at the end? I don't know."

**Personal Fit:**
- "I felt from that it was interesting working in Congress but I'm not sure that's the place for me"
- "I'm a doer. I need to..."

**Would She Do It Again?**
- "Only for the fact it was the only way I realized CIA wasn't working on the Benghazi attackers"
- "Otherwise not really. Kind of a waste of time."

**Positive Aspects:**
- Liked some people she worked with
- "Interesting to learn how Congress works or doesn't work"
- Trey Gowdy "a very interesting person"
- "Had a good mix of interesting Congress people that I learned from and saw how they did their work"

**The Core Issue:**
- "You kind of want to work on something that has an effect on the end"
- "That's the kind of person I am"

## Benghazi Attackers Status

### The Scapegoats - Two Low-Level Prisoners in US Custody

#### Ahmed Abu Khattala

**Current Status**: Convicted of terrorism charges (NOT murder charges), currently in Colorado prison

**Reality of His Involvement:**
- **Not an attacker, not the mastermind**
- "Little messed up in the head"
- **Al-Qaeda never shared the attack with Abu Khattala**

**His Actual Background:**
- During revolution: Had a little militia
- Lived in "Compton of Benghazi" - shittiest neighborhood
- About 20 guys got together, had a militia
- "Pretty good militia because they were the toughest, roughest guys"
- **After Gaddafi fell: Disbanded the militia**
- **In 2012: Khattala was NOT in a terrorist group**

**What He Actually Did Night of Attack:**
1. Sitting at home drinking tea
2. Got call from Mustafa al-Imam who just found out there's an attack
3. Mustafa: "There's attack going on at US Consulate, let's meet there"
4. They went down and met there
5. **Khattala stayed outside the entire attack** - entire time al-Qaeda was inside, he stayed outside
6. Didn't even go into compound until **after GRS and State Department left** (whole another hour later)
7. Then went in and "did a little looting"

**The US Lie:**
- US presented him as the Mastermind
- "To so they didn't have to tell you it was al-Qaeda"

**The Jury Saw Through It:**
- "The good part is the jury kind of saw through it"
- "That's why he didn't get the death penalty"
- "There needs to be evidence that he really was much of an attacker, let alone The Mastermind"

#### Mustafa al-Imam

**Current Status**: Sentenced to 19 years in prison

**Why He Was Captured:**
Adams: "Assuming only detained to back up the Khattala one"

**The Missed Opportunity:**
- Went to Libya and got Mustafa
- **Within half a mile of where Mustafa was: At least three senior Benghazi attackers**
- They were right there but ignored

**His Background:**
- **No al-Qaeda background**
- Father "maybe did a little extremist stuff"
- "Maybe was in Palestine, maybe had some sort of relationships with Hamas"
- Not "some known Hamas fighter"
- Family immigrated to Libya
- Got in trouble, put in Abu Salim prison (Gaddafi's big prison)

**Prison Connection:**
- In prison: Became best friends with Khattala
- All broken out during Libyan Revolution
- Moved to Benghazi

**His Reputation:**
Adams on how long it took to find someone who knew him:
- "Honestly you know how long it took me to find anyone in Benghazi who knew Mustafa al-Imam?"
- When she did: "That idiot. He's a nobody."
- "He was a terrorist for a few weeks or something"

**Adams' Assessment:**
- "They are low-hanging fruit"
- "Yes, I think they captured Mustafa al-Imam to strengthen the Khattala piece of their fake narrative"

**The Risk:**
- "We sent a team to go get him"
- "We risked American lives to pick up low-hanging fruit that wasn't even attacker"
- "What if some of them would have got killed?"

**Boon's Response:**
- Refused to testify at Khattala trial
- "He's not The Mastermind"
- Government knew there were people in Benghazi who knew he wasn't The Mastermind
- "Still put him on trial"
- Adams: "I feel like that's a real big lack of integrity"

### July 2023 - Ziyad Belam Capture and Release

**Who is Ziyad Belam:**
- Al-Qaeda member
- "Pretty much right now probably one of our top three or four senior al-Qaeda members at the Benghazi attacks"
- Lost his leg (travels to Turkey for medical treatment)

**The Watch List:**
- After 11 years, finally got watch listed
- "Again it was in Turkey"
- He'd been traveling back and forth to Turkey for treatment

**The Capture (July 2023):**
1. Turkish authorities at Istanbul airport captured him
2. Planned to deport him to Benghazi (where he's wanted terrorist)

**Libyan Government Structure Context:**
- **Two governments in Libya:**
  - **East government**: Where LNA (Libyan National Army) is, General Haftar
  - **West government**: One US is aligned to

**The Intervention:**
- Prime Minister of US-aligned government (West) got involved
- Told Turks: **"No, you're not sending him to Benghazi, you're sending him to Tripoli"**
- Purpose: "Having him sent to Tripoli so he can release him"

**Adams' Warning:**
- "No one believed me he was being sent to Tripoli to be released"

**What Happened:**
- Sent to Tripoli
- Held for 10 days
- **Released in July 2023**

**The US Ally Released Him:**
- "That's the US Ally"
- "That is our one point of contact in Libya"
- "He released Ziyad in July, a captured terrorist involved in Benghazi attacks"

**Why Ziyad is Emotionally Important Target:**
- **Stole a weapon night of attacks** - a SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon/belt-fed machine gun)
- CIA had two SAWs
- "99.9% sure it's our SAW"
- "He actually stole a CIA weapon the night of the attacks"

**Current Status:**
- "What do you think this guy's out doing?"
- "He was pretty spooked from what I heard"
- "Actually thinks it's a whole big operation against al-Qaeda in Libya"
- Could go either way: "Full extreme or he could go into hiding and maybe not do anything for a while"
- "It actually did spook him"

### The Libya Government-Terrorist Alignment

**How Terrorists Moved:**
- General Haftar "fighting all the terrorists"
- Started war in 2014 in East
- As he beat and killed terrorists, "they moved and they moved and they moved to Tripoli"

**Tripoli = Safe Haven:**
- Terrorists "protected by the government of Libya"
- "That's a separate government"

**Why This Happened:**
- When Libya formed after Gaddafi fell
- "Government in Libya stayed with the terrorists because the terrorists kept them in power"
- "Old LIFG guys, al-Qaeda, so they stayed aligned with the terrorists"
- **"They still are"**

**The Absurdity:**
- **"The US Ally in Libya is the same side al-Qaeda is on"**
- This has been the case for 10 years

**General Haftar's War Statistics (2014-2017):**
- **8,000 soldiers killed**
- **20,000 civilians killed**
- This demonstrates how powerful al-Qaeda got from end of 2011 to 2014

### Hamza al-Darwi (also spelled Hamal Darwi)

**Background:**
- One of the terrorists Boon "interacted with a couple times in his career"

**Pakistan Era:**
- When Adams met Boon in Pakistan, Hamza was one of top targets
- Top 20 al-Qaeda list
- Hamza on it "entire time we were in Pakistan"

**Libya Connection:**
- Adams went to Libya, then to Benghazi in August 2012
- "The day I got there," Hamza al-Darwi was top al-Qaeda target in Benghazi
- Ended up being involved in Benghazi attacks

**His Specialty - Electronics Workshop for Bin Laden:**
- When vetted in Pakistan: Was running "electronics workshop for bin Laden"
- "Bin Laden took him under his wing"
- Bin Laden's guy for innovative attack methods
- Bin Laden wanted "to find a new way to attack, a new innovative way to attack"
- Hamza was Bin Laden's guide for this
- Bin Laden gave him "whole scientific research laboratory"
- "That's what we call the electronics lab"

**His Role:**
- "Very close friend of Bin Laden"
- "Super involved in external planning"
- "Obviously was involved in Benghazi attacks"

**Current Status:**
- **In Afghanistan**
- "We know he was a top target"
- "Been a top target of US government for gosh knows how many years"
- **Sanctioned by the US**

**Adams' Frustration:**
- "It's just another big al-Qaeda guy who's Libyan in Afghanistan"
- "Why the hell is he there?"
- **"He's there training terrorist to come attack United States"**
- **"They're not doing anything about it"**

**Information Sharing:**
- "It's been shared. It's not just on the Shawn Ryan Show."
- **"I have provided to the US government that he is there. Just FYI."**

### Other Attackers - The 15 High-Value Targets in Afghanistan

**Interviewer**: "How many of these top level guys are out there that we're just ignoring?"

**Adams' Framework for Answer:**
- "There's two different things: There's guys we're ignoring and guys we thought that were dead that aren't"
- **"Both those are in Afghanistan"**

**The Count - Million Dollar+ Bounties:**
- Adams uses metric: "People who had over million dollar bounties on their head"
- "$1 million, $5 million or $10 million bounty and they're in Afghanistan right now"

**The Number**: **"I'd say there's 15 of them"**

**Important Clarification:**
- "I'm not saying Taliban. 15 that aren't Taliban because people would be like 'oh Taliban we put a million bounty.'"
- **"I'm talking al-Qaeda or other very known terrorist groups"**

### Ibrahim al-Banna (AQAP Commander)

**Background:**
- "Main AQAP target"
- AQAP = al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen)

**His Status:**
- US government "thought he was dead"

**Current Location:**
- **Afghanistan**

**His Connection:**
- **"Guess who he hangs out with? Hamza bin Laden"**
- AQAP senior leader in Afghanistan
- "Being completely ignored"

**The Bigger Picture:**
- Adams: "The thing is remember, they're on offense now and they are coming for us"
- Many locked up for 20 years, not in "nice prison United States"
- "Pul-e-Charkhi prison, really shitty prison outside Kabul"
- "There are terrorists very, very upset and they want revenge"

---

## Al-Qaeda Global Reach and Current Threat Assessment

### Al-Qaeda's True Scope

**Interviewer**: "How many countries is al-Qaeda operating in?"

**Adams' Response**: "In most countries they at least have clandestine officers"

**Depth of Entrenchment:**
- "Al-Qaeda is so entrenched in places"
- Example: "Have people working Visa lines at embassies in Europe"
- "Think about it, how many years they've been in operation"
- "There are plenty of people behind al-Qaeda that don't shoot guns - they just get ignored"
- Financial networks extensive

**Comparison to Cartels:**

**Question**: "Are they bigger than cartel?"

**Adams' Assessment:**
- **In terms of money**: "That's kind of where you get tough"
- **In bodies**: "I think they're bigger than a cartel. How much bigger..."
- **In reach**: "They have so much more reach than a cartel"

**The Difference:**
- **Cartels**: "Regional. They might have some international tie."
- **Al-Qaeda**: "Can kind of go anywhere and they have a power broker to help them do something"

**The Embassy Analogy:**
- "They're almost like an embassy"
- "Like we have embassies - US outreach all over with embassies"
- **"Al-Qaeda has that in a form"**

### ISIS Comparison

**ISIS Goals:**
- "ISIS wanted to be al-Qaeda"
- "They did a pretty damn good job"
- **"ISIS is way scarier than al-Qaeda if they were ever al-Qaeda size"**
- "They just could not get there"

**Why ISIS Didn't Reach Al-Qaeda Size:**
- "Luckily people went after them harder"
- "People targeted ISIS probably better than al-Qaeda"

**Geographic Footprint:**
- "Mostly known for Syria and Iraq"
- "But they still keep popping up"
- Example: "Couple years ago they did a lot of damage in Mozambique"
- "They keep trying to make their inroads"

**Current ISIS Activity:**
- "Really now though you're mostly hearing about the ISIS branch in Afghanistan"

### ISIS-K and The Narrative Problem

**The Reality vs. The Narrative:**

**Adams' Assessment:**
- US press and narrative "trying to say 'oh no the Taliban are a counterterrorism partner'"
- Strategy: **"Talking up ISIS-K in Afghanistan to make ISIS the threat so you ignore the Taliban's working with al-Qaeda"**

**The Truth:**
- **"Al-Qaeda is the bigger threat in Afghanistan than ISIS"**
- **"But the US government is saying ISIS is a bigger threat than al-Qaeda"**
- "That's super frustrating because it's actually not a fact"

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates false threat prioritization
- Allows al-Qaeda operations to continue with less scrutiny
- Makes Taliban appear as potential partner when they're actively harboring al-Qaeda

### Al-Qaeda's Regeneration in Afghanistan

**The Libya Model:**
Adams uses Libya as case study for regeneration timeline:

**Libya Timeline:**
- **End of October 2011**: Gaddafi fell
- **Beginning of November 2011**: Al-Qaeda started setting up real base in Benghazi
- **September 2012**: Conducted Benghazi attacks
- **2014-2017**: War against them

**Power Level in Libya:**
- From end of 2011 to 2014, reached sufficient strength to:
  - Kill 8,000 soldiers (2014-2017)
  - Kill 20,000 civilians (2014-2017)
- "That's how powerful al-Qaeda got"

**Afghanistan Timeline:**
- **August 2021**: US withdrawal
- **November 2023** (interview date): Two years since withdrawal
- **Adams' Assessment**: **"Al-Qaeda is a year away from that in Afghanistan"**

### Afghanistan - The Coming Threat Greater Than 9/11

**Scale Comparison to Pre-9/11:**

**Pre-9/11 Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan:**
- "Had little pockets of training"
- "Tarnak Farms down in Kandahar"
- "Sarobi camp outside of Kabul"
- "Little pockets in Afghanistan"

**Current Afghanistan:**
- **"Training center in every province being built in Afghanistan"**
- **"The level isn't even... the al-Qaeda that is coming is so much bigger than the al-Qaeda on 9/11"**
- **"They're already probably bigger than 9/11"**

**Progress Assessment:**
- "We're not even... we have no progress on al-Qaeda at this point"
- From geopolitical standpoint: "We have from a geopolitical standpoint we've got Russia-Ukraine going on, we have major beef with China-Taiwan"
- **"Now we have ISIS, we have al-Qaeda which is just massing incredible amounts of people and we're Enemy Number One"**

### Africa - The Lost Continent

**Current State:**
- **"Africa has become coup country"**
- "Like every country: coup, coup, coup, coup, coup, coup"
- "We can't... we're like losing all access in Africa"

**Who's Taking Over:**
- "All going to China and Russia"
- "China and Russia are taking it all"
- Not even "taking it at this point" - they have it

### Terrorist Network Interconnection

**The Main Vein Concept:**
- **"Al-Qaeda is the main vein of terrorism"**
- "If you talk about other groups like al-Shabaab, Hezbollah, whomever"
- **"Al-Qaeda links in with all of those main groups"**
- **"They're kind of like The Godfather of terrorism and everyone else is like 'ooo al-Qaeda'"**

**The Hub System:**
- "All those people are going to places like Afghanistan"
- "Because now it is al-Qaeda's hub"
- "But al-Qaeda has branches everywhere"

### Are We Al-Qaeda's Top Target?

**Interviewer**: "You think we're their number one priority? Even though we're gone?"

**Adams**: "100%"

**Why We're #1:**
- **"We're their top enemy and it always will be. It's never going to change"**
- "Remember we killed their family"
- Not just Afghanistan: "We killed their family members in Afghanistan, their terrorist family members"
- Iraq: "We killed the terrorist family members in Iraq"
- Libya: ISIS period - "We killed a bunch of them"
- Yemen: Ongoing operations
- **"There is a lot of revenge"**

### Intelligence Collection Question

**Question**: "Are we picking up traffic from them that are saying this? Do you know?"

**Adams**: "I have no idea if we're even collecting traffic anymore"

**The Gitmo Example:**
- Found newest Benghazi attacker month or two ago
- One Adams mentioned was in Gitmo
- "Talking to Kenyans"
- Libyan source to Adams: "Well I hope your country is collecting what he's saying to the Kenyans"
- **Adams' Response**: "My country doesn't even know this Gitmo guy was involved in Benghazi let alone he's still a terrorist"

**The Failure:**
- "Think of it: We haven't even collected on what happened to the Gitmo guys released"
- "Can you imagine what we're doing to anybody else?"
- **"We're not collecting on these guys"**

**Even Worse:**
- "They don't know that he's been a terrorist for 11 years"
- "When he was in Gitmo they didn't even know he was al-Qaeda"
- "None of his Gitmo files say he was al-Qaeda - zero"
- Yet "he was al-Qaeda when they picked him up and put him in Gitmo"

**Adams**: "This is not painting a good picture, Sarah."
**Response**: "I know it's not"

---

## Threat to the Homeland

### Southern Border Assessment

**Question**: "Do you think they're going to come through the southern border?"

**Adams' Assessment:**
- **"I think the southern border is the easiest place to come through"**
- Alternative: **"But if they can get in a refugee pipeline they can come straight in"**

### The Refugee Pipeline Danger

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- "The refugee pipeline is very dangerous"

**The Afghan Passport Transformation:**

**Common Argument People Make:**
- "There's been terrorist attacks all around the world and Afghans weren't involved in them"

**The Explanation:**
- **"It's because the Afghan passport was so weak"**
- Afghan passport historically had no power/access

**The Current Situation:**
- **"Now the Afghan passport is extremely powerful"**

**Why:**
- "A lot of humanitarians are like 'we need to save these Afghans from the terrorists'"
- **"So Afghans are being brought in all over the world"**
- **"And al-Qaeda is like 'holy crap'"**

**The Libya Precedent:**
- **"Our terrorists in Libya were given official Libyan passports and fake names"**
- **"It's the exact same thing the Taliban's doing"**
- "The terrorists can get passports for other countries even now"

**Multiple Entry Methods:**
- Don't have to come over the border
- **"But there are some still doing the border to actually even just to see if they can do it and test it"**
- Purpose: **"To learn about our weaknesses"**

### Terrorist Methodology - Learning Our Weaknesses

**Adams' Detainee Debriefing Experience:**
- "I used to do detainee debriefings"
- "I'm trying to learn about them"
- **"But you pay a lot of attention to what they're trying to learn about you"**

**Their Approach:**
- **"They are going to find our weaknesses"**
- **"Our southern border is probably our biggest weakness right now"**

### Information Adams Has Shared - The Ignored Warning

**A Year Ago:**
- "I did provide something really good"
- "It actually did go up to the White House level"
- **"They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"**

**Why She Can't Discuss:**
- "Probably not in this forum without talking to all the other people involved as you can imagine who would be at risk"
- "The negatives: If you don't go after info you still want to keep your people in play who can collect that info"
- "In the hopes that maybe the US will finally come around and go after the terrorist"
- "You don't want to obviously lose the people who can report that info"

**The Pattern:**
Adams regularly provides intelligence on terrorist locations:
- Her response when she shares terrorist locations: **"I really just get 'thanks for your info.' Nothing happens."**

### Why No Action Against Known Terrorists in Afghanistan

**Question**: "Why do you think they're not going after these guys?"

**Adams' Answer:**
- **"Because they want you to believe al-Qaeda does not exist in Afghanistan"**
- **"So how can you kill an al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan?"**

**The Strategy:**
- **"Why do they want us to believe that? Because they want us to forget about Afghanistan and move on"**

**Where She's Hearing This:**
- **"I've heard this from congressmen"**
- **"I'm hearing this"**
- "They really think this is just going to go away"
- Assesses probability: **"100%"**

**What's Preventing It From Going Away:**
- **"The only reason Afghanistan hasn't gone away is all these pesky volunteers like me, like Scott [Mann], whomever, still trying to save their Afghans"**
- **"We've gotten in their way and they're sick of it"**
- **"They're just waiting to plow through us until it's not in the press anymore and it's ignored and they can move on"**
- "They never want it to go on for two more years"
- **"We're like annoying them at this point"**

### Potential Recourse Against Volunteers

**Question**: "Do you think there's going to be any recourse towards you or Scott or anybody?"

**Adams' Response:**
- "Since there's like a thousand of us helping Afghans, I mean I doubt it"
- "There was some - in some government agencies they had people did go after, they were gone after for actually helping with the Evac"

**Adams' Personal Experience:**
- **"My job - very different. My bosses were super supportive of me being involved in the Afghan evacuation"**
- **"A large number of people in my office actually supported it"**

**The Real Divide:**
- **"I think the majority of actually worker bees in the US government were supportive of helping Afghans"**
- **"It's kind of the senior level stuff that we all stay out of"**
- **"I think normal everyday people who have worked counterterrorism their whole career are very concerned about Afghanistan"**

## The Next Attack - Threat Assessment

### Probability of Another 9/11-Scale Attack

**Question**: "What do you think the probability of another 9/11 attack is?"

**Replicating 9/11 Exactly:**
- "I think exactly how it's done is hard"
- "To replace Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) who planned it"
- **"I'm not going to lie, he was a genius"**

**Their Intentions:**
- **"But do they want to do something at that level? Yes"**
- **"Do I think that they will do something more innovative than 9/11? Definitely"**

**Innovation Attempts:**
- "Remember they tried it with the liquids on the airplanes"

**The Next Attack:**
- **"I think the next attack will probably be something more innovative"**
- **"I don't think it's going to be 3,000 [deaths] but I don't think it's going to matter if it's 3,000"**

**Why Casualty Count Won't Matter:**
- **"Because they want to hit here and they want to show they can do it"**
- **"They want to do something spectacular"**

### How Adams Knows They Want to Hit US

**Interviewer**: "How do you know that they want to hit here?"

**Adams**:
- **"Because we're their top enemy and it always will be"**
- **"It's never going to change"**
- Memory of past actions: "Remember we locked up a lot of these guys for 20 years and we didn't lock them up in a nice prison United States - they were in Pul-e-Charkhi prison, really shitty prison outside Kabul"
- **"There are terrorists very, very upset and they want revenge"**

### Collection Gap

**Question**: "Are we picking up traffic from them that are saying this? Do you know?"

**Adams**: **"I have no idea if we're even collecting traffic anymore"**

**The Gitmo Example Showing Collection Failure:**
- Recently found newest Benghazi attacker
- Guy is in Gitmo "talking to Kenyans"
- Libyan source to Adams: "I hope your country is collecting what he's saying to the Kenyans"
- Adams' thought: **"My country doesn't even know this Gitmo guy was involved in Benghazi let alone he's still a terrorist"**
- "They don't know he's been a terrorist for 11 years"
- "When he was in Gitmo they didn't even know he was al-Qaeda"
- "None of his Gitmo files say he was al-Qaeda"

**Adams' Conclusion**:
- "Think of it: We haven't even collected on what happened to the Gitmo guys released"
- "Can you imagine what we're doing to anybody else?"
- **"We're not collecting on these guys"**

## The Libyan Revolution Reality

### The Democratic Movement Myth

**Public Perception:**
- Libyan Revolution seen as "democratic movement"
- Image of ordinary citizens rising up

**The Reality:**
- **"The Libyan Revolution was not some democratic movement"**
- **"It was terrorist taking it to Gaddafi because he locked them up forever"**
- **"Most of the people fighting it or at least leading militias were terrorists"**

**Al-Qaeda's Role:**
- **"Al-Qaeda brought in lots of terrorists to fight the Libyan Revolution"**

**The Disconnect:**
- "There seems to be a really complete disconnect"
- People think: "It's all libyans who I was a barber and now I'm a warrior"
- Reality: **"Yeah but you worked for the terrorists that ran your group"**

### US Role in Libyan Revolution

**What US Did:**
- **"The Libyan Revolution - we were air support"**
- **"We dropped stuff from planes"**
- **"That's how we helped them win"**

**What US Did NOT Do:**
- Not like Soviet-Afghan War (Charlie Wilson's War model)
- **"Nothing like the Soviet War"**

## Positive Elements - The Resistance

### Interviewer: "Do you have any positive news?"

**Adams**: "I tried to... I thought this was a Shawn Ryan Show. I try to end every show with something positive but I'm drawing a blank right now."

### What She Offers as Positive

**The Good Americans:**
- **"There's a lot of good Americans who've spent 20 years working counterterrorism"**
- **"Who are trying to get the word out: Focus on this threat, make this a priority"**

**When Not Getting Answers:**
- "When they're not getting answers"
- "They might work in parts of the government"
- **"They're going and collecting it themselves"**
- **"They are trying to do something"**

**Better Than Before:**
- "It's better than I feel like after Benghazi nobody did anything"
- "I feel now, I'm hoping now after Afghanistan people like:"
- **"'We're not going to let this happen. Not on my watch'"**
- **"That's what we kind of all need to come together"**

### The Afghan Resistance

**Question**: "Do you think that the resistance has any hope of taking their country back?"

**Their Advantage:**
- **"The good thing about the resistance is what I'm saying to you - they know all that"**
- **"The resistance aren't naive"**
- **"They are the experts"**
- **"They know their enemy which is the most valuable thing because we really don't know our enemy most of the time"**

**What They Need:**
- **"The Resistance has to build a very powerful coalition"**
- **"That's how they win"**

**The Problem:**
- "If they keep separated or keep anything ethnic it's just not going to be enough"
- "Because the Taliban is so big and so powerful"

**The Math:**
- "They have to hit back with the same strength"
- "I don't even know what percentage of bodies of Taliban it is"
- "I don't know if they're 40 or 50% of the population"
- **"Then your resistance has to be 40 to 50% of the population"**
- "That's what they have to get to"

**Can They Win:**
- **"I think they can win but it's going to be a lot of guerrilla stuff"**
- "Taliban are the better armed"
- **"I'm positive that they can win but they all have to come together"**
- **"There has to be a catalyst to bring them all together"**
- "We haven't seen that happen yet"

## Key Concepts and Analyses

### Al-Qaeda's Operational Methodology

**Kidnapping for Prisoner Exchange Strategy**
- Ambassador Stevens kidnapping planned for exchanges
- 3 weeks prior: Quds Force officer kidnapped for 5 AQI prisoners
- 2011: Many terrorists released, creating momentum
- 2012: Continued push to "keep trying to get out who we can get out"

**Innovation Focus**
- Constantly seeking new attack methods
- Hamza al-Darwi ran "electronics workshop" for bin Laden
- Given "whole scientific research laboratory"
- Attempted liquids on airplanes
- Next attack "will probably be something more innovative"
- Won't necessarily be 3,000 casualties but will be "spectacular"

**Network Effects**
- "Main vein of terrorism"
- Links with all major groups (Al-Shabaab, Hezbollah, Hamas, etc.)
- "The Godfather of terrorism"
- Almost like embassies: "US outreach all over with embassies, al-Qaeda has that in a form"
- People working visa lines at European embassies
- Financial networks extensive
- Non-combat support infrastructure
- "Plenty of people behind al-Qaeda that don't shoot guns - they just get ignored"

**Learning and Adaptation**
- Constantly probing weaknesses
- Testing southern border "to see if they can do it and test it and learn about our weaknesses"
- Adams: "Terrorists are always looking at our weaknesses"
- From detainee debriefings: "You pay a lot of attention to what they're trying to learn about you"

### US Government Patterns of Failure

**Narrative Over Reality**
- Video lie created and maintained despite evidence
- ISIS-K emphasized over al-Qaeda in Afghanistan
- Taliban presented as "counterterrorism partner"
- Khattala presented as mastermind when he wasn't
- "They want you to believe al-Qaeda does not exist in Afghanistan"

**Compartmentalization**
- "They want to compartmentalize everything"
- "Make Benghazi this little thing on the side that randomly happened"
- Reality: "It's a piece of the whole pie"
- "These things are so much bigger... it's all connected"

**Hope It Goes Away Strategy**
- "They want us to forget about Afghanistan and move on"
- "They really think this is just going to go away - 100%"
- "Waiting to plow through us until it's not in the press anymore"
- "They never want it to go on for two more years"
- Volunteers helping Afghans: "We're like annoying them at this point"

**Collection Gaps**
- "I have no idea if we're even collecting traffic anymore"
- Gitmo detainee files missing al-Qaeda affiliation
- "Haven't even collected on what happened to the Gitmo guys released"
- "Can you imagine what we're doing to anybody else? We're not collecting on these guys"

**Intelligence to Action Gap**
- Adams provides terrorist locations regularly
- Response: "I really just get 'thanks for your info.' Nothing happens"
- Year before interview: Intelligence to White House level
- "They decided they didn't want to do anything with it"
- "So how can you kill an al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan?"

**Resource Misallocation**
- All resources to Tripoli (Facebook threat) while attack ongoing in Benghazi
- Teams sent to Italy instead of Libya
- FAST team uniform debates when clearances already granted
- Scapegoats captured while senior leaders within half mile

**Accountability Failures**
- Bob: Highest CIA award, returned to training position
- Jake Sullivan: National Security Advisor
- Ben Rhodes: Continued senior role
- Hillary Clinton: No prosecution
- Obama: No accountability for Vegas trip
- Broader: "Fuck up, move up"

### The Passport/Documentation Exploitation

**Libya Precedent**
- "Our terrorists in Libya were given official Libyan passports and fake names"
- "It's the exact same thing the Taliban's doing"

**Afghan Passport Transformation**
- Historically very weak passport
- "Now the Afghan passport is extremely powerful"
- Reason: "Humanitarians are like 'we need to save these Afghans from the terrorists'"
- "So Afghans are being brought in all over the world"
- "And al-Qaeda is like 'holy crap'"

**Multiple Avenues**
- Refugee pipelines (most powerful)
- Southern border (testing and probing)
- Official passports from compliant governments
- "The terrorists can get passports for other countries even now"

### Congressional Limitations

**What Congress Produces**
- "They write great reports"
- "Our report is excellent"

**What Congress Lacks**
- "Congress doesn't have a lot of teeth"
- "What's it do?"
- "They don't use the carrots and sticks they need"
- "Congress holds all the money but they never actually go make the threats or force people to make the change"

**Future Commissions**
- "They're going to make this big Afghanistan War commission"
- "Is there teeth at the end? I don't know"

### Al-Qaeda Regeneration Timeline

**Libya Model** (provides concrete data):
- End October 2011: Gaddafi fell
- Beginning November 2011: Al-Qaeda setting up base
- September 2012: Conducted sophisticated 150-person operation
- 2014-2017: Powerful enough to cause 8,000 soldier deaths, 20,000 civilian deaths
- **Approximately 3 years from zero to major threat**

**Afghanistan Trajectory**:
- August 2021: US withdrawal, Taliban takeover
- November 2023 (interview): 2+ years since withdrawal
- Adams: "Al-Qaeda is a year away from that in Afghanistan"
- But: "A thousand times bigger because..."

**Scale Comparison**:
- Pre-9/11 Afghanistan: "Little pockets of training" (Tarnak Farms, Sarobi)
- Current Afghanistan: "Training center in every province being built"
- "The level isn't even... the al-Qaeda that is coming is so much bigger than the al-Qaeda on 9/11"
- **"They're already probably bigger than 9/11"**

### The Revenge Factor

**Who Wants Revenge:**
- Families of those killed in Afghanistan
- Families of those killed in Iraq
- Families of those killed in Libya
- Families of those killed in Yemen
- Those imprisoned 20 years in harsh conditions

**The Numbers:**
- "We killed their family"
- "We killed their family members in Afghanistan"
- "We killed the terrorist family members in Iraq"
- Many "spent 20 years" in Pul-e-Charkhi (very harsh prison)
- "There are terrorists very, very upset and they want revenge"

**Permanence:**
- "We're their top enemy and it always will be"
- "It's never going to change"
- Not dependent on US presence in any country
- Generational and ideological, not situational

### The Resistance Equation

**What They Have:**
- Knowledge: "They know all that... they are the experts"
- Understanding: "They know their enemy which is the most valuable thing"
- Not naive: "The resistance aren't naive"

**What They Need:**
- Size: "Has to be 40 to 50% of the population" to match Taliban
- Unity: "All have to come together"
- Coalition: "Very powerful coalition - that's how they win"
- Catalyst: "There has to be a catalyst to bring them all together"

**Current Status:**
- Haven't achieved unity yet
- "If they keep separated or keep anything ethnic it's just not going to be enough"
- Taliban "so big and so powerful"

**Can They Win:**
- "I think they can win"
- "But it's going to be a lot of guerrilla stuff"
- "Taliban are the better armed"
- "I'm positive that they can win but they all have to come together"

### Media and Public Understanding

**The Scapegoat Effect:**
- Hillary Clinton becomes focal point
- "She's like the scapegoat"
- "She's done a million things wrong but God there's so many other people"
- Jake Sullivan, Ben Rhodes, Obama, DOD - all escape scrutiny
- "Problem's way bigger than Hillary"

**Compartmentalization Success:**
- Public thinks: "Little thing on the side that randomly happened"
- Reality: "Piece of the whole pie"
- "It's all connected"
- "These things are so much bigger"
- "They want to make Benghazi this little thing... they want to compartmentalize everything"

**The Wish for Public Understanding:**
- "I wish I could just get through to people"
- "Not buy off on everything they see on the news"
- "You are the type of person that briefs the White House and people are still going to go to news"
- "I don't know how to get through to them"

**Media Role:**
- "Media has really turned into just a state megaphone"
- News creates false narratives
- Scapegoats presented
- Broader failures ignored

---

## Weapons and Equipment

**SAW** (Squad Automatic Weapon)
- Belt-fed machine gun
- CIA had two in Benghazi
- Ziyad Belam stole one
- "99.9% sure it's our SAW"
- Makes Ziyad "emotional top target" for Adams' team

**MANPADs in Libya**
- NOT Stingers (US-made from Afghan war)
- Russian SA-7s and SA-9s
- From Gaddafi stockpiles
- Proliferated everywhere after Gaddafi fell
- Mission: "Get rid of them so terrorists don't get them"

**Fighter Jets**
- French had them in region (could have responded)
- US "didn't even think of sending fighter jets"

**Mortars**
- 10-man team hit CIA Annex
- Wasam bin Hamid's operation
- One member recently identified, nine more to go (Adams' current focus)

## Additional Context and Clarifications

### What "Covert Action" Means in This Context
- Democrats believed Adams knew about classified programs
- Specifically thought Benghazi Annex was running weapons to Syria
- This was a conspiracy theory
- Adams explains: If moving weapons to Syria, would go through Turkey, not Benghazi
- No such weapons operation existed

### The "Fake Mastermind" Concept
- US government needed someone to blame
- Couldn't admit it was sophisticated al-Qaeda operation
- Chose Khattala who barely participated
- Allowed narrative that wasn't "al-Qaeda planned this"
- Jury somewhat saw through it (terrorism charges, not murder, no death penalty)

### Why Bob Relied on 17th February
- Didn't believe in CIA GRS as QRF concept
- Viewed local militia as proper response force
- This was deviation from standard CIA practice
- "Disconnect from how CIA operates in Benghazi just solely because of Bob"

### The Two Deaths vs Four Deaths Distinction
- First two deaths (Ambassador Stevens, Sean Smith): Preventable if GRS left on time
- Second two deaths (Tyrone Woods, Glen Doherty): From separate attack on CIA Annex by Wasam bin Hamid
- Adams focuses analysis on what could have prevented each set

### Why Terrorists Came Together for This Operation
- Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri personally coordinated
- Revenge for deputies killed in Pakistan
- Honor fallen Libyans killed in drone strikes
- Free important prisoners
- Multiple branches contributed (AQAP funding and fatwa, Egypt personnel, AQIM execution)
- "All these al-Zawahiri people come together to do this operation"

### The Gitmo Files Failure
- Detainee was al-Qaeda when captured
- Files don't reflect this
- "None of his Gitmo files say he was al-Qaeda - zero"
- Shows: "Gitmo debriefings done well... zero"
- Now released, still a terrorist
- Talking to Kenyans (potential operations?)
- US probably not collecting this intelligence

### Why Libya Government Protects Terrorists
- After Gaddafi fell, government formed
- Needed power base to maintain control
- Terrorists/old LIFG provided that power
- "Government in Libya stayed with the terrorists because the terrorists kept them in power"
- This is the government US is allied with
- Has been this way for 10 years
- "The US Ally in Libya is the same side al-Qaeda is on"

### The Humanitarian Passport Pipeline
- Well-intentioned humanitarian efforts
- Trying to save Afghans from Taliban/terrorists
- Creates documentation for anyone with Afghan passport
- Taliban controls passport issuance
- Gives real Afghan passports to terrorists with fake identities
- "Exact same thing the Taliban's doing" as Libya did
- Terrorists don't need to cross borders illegally
- Can enter through refugee programs with valid documentation

---

## Final Assessment - Sarah Adams' Current Mission

**Immediate Focus**:
Identify remaining 9 members of 10-man mortar team that attacked CIA Annex

**Broader Mission**:
Track and document all Benghazi attackers, particularly senior al-Qaeda figures

**Why She Does This Work**:
- CIA is not actively pursuing these terrorists
- Government wants to forget Afghanistan and Benghazi
- "Worker bees" in government care but senior leadership doesn't act
- After Benghazi "nobody did anything"
- After Afghanistan hoping people say "not on my watch"

**How to Support/Follow**:
- Book available on Amazon and Barnes & Noble
- Instagram: Askari Media Group
- Website: askariMediaGroup.com
- Note: Content includes humor about terrorists ("if you don't like humor around terrorism maybe don't come to it")

**Her Hope**:
That Americans who spent 20 years in counterterrorism will "come together" and not let threats be ignored, saying "we're not going to let this happen" like they feel happened after Benghazi.

I need you to read all of the REPORT.*.md files and use the information contained within to write targetted drilled down reports, each in their own md file.

I need reports of the following, each in their own markdown file:

- Locations of interest: any locations mentioned in the reports should be reported on, along with any information related to the mention of that location.
- Weapons systems: any mention of weapons systems should be reported on, along with any informaton related to the mention of that weapons system
- Persons of interest: any people that are mentioned should be reported on, along with relevant information such as status (dead/alive), position (eg. commander/fighter) and any relationships to other people, cash on hand, etc
- Heirarcy: the structure of the terrorist networks including people and organizational units
- International connectons and support: build a picture of the different state and non state actors, groups, NGOs, etc that have connections to or provide support to Al Queda from the reports
- Funding/money: any funding or mentions of money or funds transfer should be reported on, including amounts, one time payments, ongoing payments, the source and benefactor, what the money is earmarked for vs what it is actually used for etc
- Overall Timeline: an overall timeline should be built to show the chronological history of events in the reports, both historical events and future or planned events
- Attack Timeline: a timeline specfically for terrorist attacks from the reports, including historical or future/planned/estimated events
- Key takeways: build some key takeaways from recurring concepts or really important parts from the reports

If you have any ideas or extra reports that may be useful or helpful to understand the problem domain from your perusal of the reports please mention them once you are finished with the reports listed above.
